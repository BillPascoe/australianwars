342,td0ce9,1336,"Darkie Point, Bellinger River",Site,"In the autumn of 1841, three shepherds on Frederick Eldershaw's outstation on the north eastern edge of New England were brutally murdered and 2000 sheep taken by Baanbay warriors (Eldershaw, 1854, p 63). In reprisal Eldershaw organised a 'pursuing party' of ten men (including Eldershaw, three neighbours and six stockmen), 'well mounted and accoutred' and set off with ten days provisions for the south branch of the Clarence River. According to Eldershaw the party was ambushed by fire on at least one occasion, and after several days, they found the Baanbay camp and the sheep towards evening and split their party in two. One group remained hidden near the camp, and the other, with Eldershaw in the lead, moved to a higher ground above the camp of about 200 Baanbay. When they heard a shot fired below, in reprisal for Baanbay warriors killing one of the men, the group above immediately discharged the 'contents of ten barrels' into the camp below. A second volley from below and a third from above 'dealt frightful havoc in their ranks' and 'according to Eldershaw 'some [of the Baanbay] actually dashed themselves in frantic violence to the depths beneath, in utter heedlessness of life' (Eldershaw 1854, p 73). 'Shot after shot, with curses wild and deep the excited fellows launched at their hated foes - their butchered comrades' blood was that night fearfully avenged' (Eldershaw, 1854, p 73).
<br>
It is estimated that at least 30 Baanbay people were shot. In his book Eldershaw justified the massacre on the grounds that it instilled in the local Aboriginal people 'a mysterious and superstitious fear of the stupendous power of the white man', caused them to become 'harmless, tractable and <i>subdued</i>' and thus the  'barbarous and inhuman <i>secret</i> murders [of colonists], by poison or by some violent remorseless treachery, of which in preceding times I had so frequently heard and read, were now happily abolished' (Eldershaw 1854, p 74).

'On the 23rd instant, information was given to the Armidale
police that a most dreadfull massacre had been committed the day before, at the Bald Hills' station,
(Mr. Allen's) in this district, near the Clarence line
of road. The unfortunate sufferers were Mary
Mason, and her two children, of the respective
ages of 3 and 18 months, and John Meldrum ...
On the information being received,
the chief constable proceeded to the scene, but
could not succeed in capturing any of the scoundrels;
in fact, the police force in this district is so miserably deficient in numbers, that life is not safe even
in the vicinity of the town from these savages. We
trust that the Inspector-General of Police will see
the necessity of immediately supplying the deficiency: otherwise it is likely that the people will
either leave their various employments in the bush,
or take the law into their own hands'
(<i>The Goulburn Herald and County of Argyle Advertiser</i>, 18 Sep 1852, p 3).
<br>
According to an article published in 1932, Major Parke led a group of colonists who shot a 'great number' of Aboriginal people in reprisal for the killing of the Meldrum family. The date given as '1856' in this article is most likely a misprint, as the murders occurred in 1852.
'In 1856 aboriginals attacked
Meldrum's home and killed all the inmates with the exception of a baby
who had been thrown against a wall
and left there stunned. A man named
Imray (or Emery), who had been out
on the run shepherding sheep, on his
return to the homestead found the
bodies of the murdered people and also
discovered the baby which had re
covered and was lying beside a cat.
The blacks who were responsible for
the tragedy were tracked over the
rough country and were discovered on
a creek on the Macleay. A great number of them were shot by Major Parke
and other residents of the district who
had joined in the chase' (<i>Dungog Chronicle: Durham and Gloucester Advertiser</i>, 7 Jun 1932, p 4).

Indigenous historian Callum Clayton-Dixon summarised the sequence of events thus:  'Following the killing of several colonists in the Bald Hills area in August 1852, a group of Aboriginal people were chased to the edge of a sheer bluff south of Ebor and were either shot or pushed over the edge, probably both.

However, on being sworn, he recollected himself, and confirmed Brown's statement, naming two other servants who were also aware of the fact - namely, the hutkeeper who had been wounded [earlier by a 'black fellow'], and another named Coppin, the latter of whom he said had mixed the arsenic with the flour. On learning what had occurred, Captain Griffin, who was then in Brisbane, started for his station. The Police Magistrate also dispatched a constable to bring in the other two men. Captain Griffin was, however, the first to reach the station, and was on his way back to Brisbane before the constable arrived at the Pine River. When the constable at length reached the men, they were of course prepared to accompany. They had not absconded, but came down at once. They denied that any mixture had been deliberately made of the flour and arsenic by any one, but admitted that a quantity of flour only had been left in the hut, and that the blacks themselves had mixed it in a dish in which there were some remains of arsenic that had used in the preparation for the sheep. The evidence of these persons has been sent to the Attorney-General, [in Sydney] who will probably institute some further inquiries on the subject.

33,td0d10,1336,K'Gari / Fraser Island,Site,"According to Lauer (1977), after almost a decade of conflict between colonists and Aboriginal people in the 'Wide Bay' region, Aboriginal people had established K'Gari (Fraser Island) as a base of operations:
<br>
'Following these engagements, the Aborigines withdrew to Fraser Island, which, according to the whites, they seemed to be using as a convenient natural fortress, for the avoidance of European reprisal raids. At a meeting of the three Native Police officers with Magistrate Bidwell and local squatter, Edward B. Uhr, in mid-February 1851, it was maintained that on previous occasions the natives had retired to the island ""after committing murders"" and that this place was tactically regarded by them ""as a stronghold from which they can issue at any time to commit fresh crimes.""' (Lauer, 1977, p 52) 
<br>
Between 24 December 1851 and 3 January 1852 a punitive expedition led by Commandant Frederick Walker, Lt Marshall and Sgt Major Dolan, and 24 troopers along with the captain and crew of the schooner 'Margaret and Mary', who were all armed and sworn in as special constables, was carried out on Fraser Island to 'break up' Aboriginal clans that had sought sanctuary on the island. According to Lauer, Walkers report cautious in it's details, unbelievable in parts and did not account for many days, even though 'This campaign of 1851-2 - the largest Native Police manoeuvre in the Northern Districts to that date - seems to mark another turning point in frontier relations.' (Lauer, 1977, p54) Walker did report that 'on the 24th, his troopers fired on retreating boats of natives, and ""several balls struck"", as well as how, on the night of the 27th, the Fraser Islanders ""made frequent attempts to surprise the Native Police camp"", again suffering casualties in doing so.' (Lauer, 1977, p54)
<br>
According to colonists at the time Aboriginal people were 'driven into the sea, and kept there as long as daylight and life lasted' (Lauer, 1977).
<br>
Some comparable details, such as the deputisation of colonists, the killings on the beach and victims driven into the water, suggest this may be the same, or related to a massacre written from oral history by Vic Collins. According to Vic Collins a massacre took place just to the south of K'Gari on the mainland at Teewah Beach, north of Noosa: 'The convicts were given their freedom provided they donned a red uniform (Red Coats) to keep the blacks in order. Stationed at Maryborough word came of a tribe of blacks stealing sheep from Mannumbar Station (on their way bay from Bunya Mts) Noosa blacks were blamed. The Red Coats track them to Teewah Beach. They were ordered to ride out on the beach and shoot the men (single shot muzzle loaders) then use swords on the remainder which they did. But children took to the water, so the officer in charge ordered the red coats to ride their horeses into the surf and trample the children till they drowned.'

<br>
The shootings at Manumbar were reported as part of the <i>Select Committee on the Native Police Force, 1861</i>. On 6 July, 1861 E.M.V. Morisset, Esq., Commandant of the Native Police was called in and examined about several incidents, including the following details about the massacre:
<br>
'It appears from the evidence of Mr. Mortimer and another, that the detachment in charge
of Lieutenant Morisset was sent up on the remonstrance of Mr Parkinson and some others,
and that they killed a number of blacks, and left them lying dead about his run - we have
heard of at least eight found dead in that way. Do you think this a justifiable act under the
circumstances? Yes, I think so; perhaps I may be allowed to explain. I received a report
from Mr. Morisset (Vide appendix B) which is now in the Colonial Secretary's office; he was
on his way to head-quarters with a number of horses, and when he got to this district on his
way up to Wide Bay, he was informed by several squatters that the blacks were very troublesome killing cattle, and that they threatened to attack the horses. He reported this to Mr.
Murray, when he got to Wide Bay, and Lieutenant Murray sent him back with a detachment
of his own men. When Mr. Morisset got back, he found the blacks in large numbers at the
Bunya Bunya, and, I think, he first dispersed them there, and then met them again somewhere
else - at least, the blacks found he was following them, and went in towards the station of
the Messrs. Mortimer, and got close to it, when the Police came up with them. I believe they
thought the Police were coming to shoot them, and made the first attack, the report that
has been sent in to the Colonial Secretary has not explained that as fully as I have done, as I
collected more particulars from my brother afterwards, having examined him when he came in
to head-quarters' (QP V&P LA 1861(b), p 144).
<br>
The report of the incident is included
 in <i>Appendix B. 'Officer's Report, &c., In Reference To An Attack On The Blacks At Manumbar'</i>, as follows:
<br>
'Rockhampton, 10th April, 1861.  
<br>Sir I have the honor to inform you that I arrived here yesterday, with (32)  
thirty-two horses, the same having been purchased by me for the use of the Native Police.  
On my way up from Brisbane I found it necessary to rest the horses for some time  
at ""Wide Bay, and in consequence of the numerous complaints sent in by the squatters, of  
the frequent and daring outrages of the blacks at the Bunya Bunya, I received instructions  
from Lieutenant Murray to patrol the district with a detachment of men. I found the  
blacks collected in several places in very large numbers, and also that they had been killing  
cattle at nearly all the stations in that district; and on two or three occasions I found it  
necessary to fire upon them before they would disperse.  
At Messrs. Frazer and Parkinson's, and also at Mr. Lawless' cattle station, they  
were spearing cattle even while I was on the station.  
I have the honor to enclose brands and descriptions of horses purchased by me.

Lieutenant Wheeler did not deny this but claimed that he had been instructed to 'disperse' Aboriginal people where ever they gathered. 
'The result of our investigations has been the establishment of the truth of all that we previously asserted, and the confirmation of the impression that the attack upon the blacks was most wanton and unprovoked. It appears that, upon the occasion of the massacre, the blacks were holding a corroboree, and that, while they were so engaged, the Native Police surprised their camp, fired upon them, and killed seven men and one gin, besides wounding others, one of whom, an old gin, has not yet recovered. Most of the bodies have been removed by the blacks themselves, but two were still lying at the scene of the slaughter when one of our informants last visited the spot. One of the men shot was well known about town by the soubriquet of Harry Pring, and was not altogether an immaculate being, but we are not aware that his murderers were justified in shooting him down in cold blood, together with seven of his companions. We cannot gather that the blacks had lately been troublesome in the locality where the massacre occurred; our informants state positively that they had been very peaceably and quietly disposed of late, and had done nothing to justify the attack made by the Native Police. Lieutenant Wheeler, the officer in charge of the detachment, we are told defends his conduct on the ground that his instructions compel him to disperse the blacks wherever they may have congregated, but we have yet to learn that those instructions warrant such an act as that to which we refer.'

'One day, when he [Henry Stormont Finch-Hatton?] knew that a large mob of Blacks were watching his movements, he packed a large dray with rations, and set off with it from the head station, as if he was going the rounds of the shepherds' huts. When he got opposite to the Long Lagoon, one of the wheels came off the dray, and down it went with a crash. This appeared to annoy him considerably; but after looking pensively at it for some time, he seemed to conclude that there was nothing to be done, so he unhitched the horses and led them back to the station. No sooner had he disappeared than, of course, all the Blacks came up to the dray to see what was in it. To their great delight it contained a vast supply of flour, beef and sugar. With appetites sharpened by a prolonged abstinence from such delicacies, they lost no time in carrying the rations down to the waterside, and forthwith devoured them as only a Blackfellow can. 
Alas for the greediness of the savage! Alas for the cruelty of the white brother! The rations contained about as much strychnine as anything else, and not one of the mob escaped. When they awoke in the morning they were all dead corpses. More than a hundred Blacks were stretched out by the ruse of the owner of the Long Lagoon.

With this they complied, and turned them back over the creek, and then sat down awaiting the arrival of the cattle. They were not allowed to remain long in peace, for the natives, having left their gins on the other side, swam over the creek and tried to surround them. Being thus forced into a 'row,' the Brothers determined to let them have it, only regretting that some of the party were not with them, so as to make the lesson a more severe one. The assailants spread out in a circle to try and surround them, but seeing eight or nine of their companions drop, made them think better of it, and they were finally hunted back again across the river, leaving their friends behind them. The firing was heard by the cattle party, but before they could come up, the fray was over.'  F .J.

'We have been favored by Mr. W. H Campbell with the following account of the prompt retribution visited upon the blacks near Cooktown for their unprovoked and wanton attack upon Messrs. Hartley and Sykes:

""Your readers have already been made acquainted with the particulars concerning the recent outrage of the blacks at Cooktown, when Captain Sykes and Mr Hartley were severely wounded in an attempt to bring off a cedar log from the north shore of Cooktown harbor. I can now give a history of subsequent events in what has proved to be a tragedy of no mean interest. On February 7 (the day following the affray), a party of three crossed the harbor with the intention of securing and bringing back the articles left behind by Captain Sykes. The party consisted of Mr Browne of the <i>Herald</i> office, a boatman named Harris, and myself."" The group found and followed tracks for some time and found recently abandoned gunyas before returning to their boat and sailing for Cooktown.

'A party of six native troopers and two Europeans, who started out the night previous, and crossed the Endeavor twenty miles above us, never reached the scene of the affray, the intervening swamps being uncrossable by the horses. On Thursday the 14 instant [February], sub-Inspector [Stanthorpe] O'Connor with 6 troopers crossed the harbour in a boat at night and by moonlight picked up the tracks of the blacks. The latter however, discerned the approach of the troopers, and retreated across the ranges to the ocean beach. The inspector then divided his forces, and with one party, made a detour in the direction of Cape Bedford, and by Sunday morning [16 February], had hemmed the blacks within a narrow gorge, of which both outlets were secured by the troopers. There were twenty eight men and thirteen gins thus enclosed, of whom some of the former escaped. Twenty four were shot down on the beach, and four swam out to sea. The Inspector and his men then sat down on the beach, and waited for the swimmers to return, but without success, and after several hours they were lost sight of, it is conjectured they were drowned. One woman also swam out from the land, and after remaining four hours in the water, was captured by a trooper, who went in after her. The men [troopers] hunted up the remainder of the gins, and having found a meerschaum pipe and tomahawk in their possession belonging to Mr Hartley, the inspector was satisfied he had not killed innocent people.

Eight days later all three perished of thirst after reaching Number 5 island which they thought had no water. Mary Watson kept a diary of the dreadful voyage, which was found some months later among the mangroves. When passing vessels reported the destruction of the cottage and fires fiercely burning across Lizard Island, it was assumed that Mary Watson had been kidnapped and/or killed. In reprisal, 2nd class inspector Hervey Fitzgerald set off from Cooktown with a detachment of native police for Lizard Island and when they arrived 'dispersed' 150 Aboriginal people at Snake River.

In the course of the Kaititja attack, Station Master James Laurence Oliver Stapleton and Linesman John Franks were killed.

Over the next six weeks, Police Trooper Samuel Gason '...with assistance from a constable from The Peak and staff from the Barrow Creek and Tennant Creek Telegraph Stations...carried out four punitive expeditions against Aboriginal people between Taylor Creek and Central Mount Stuart' (Barrow Creek Telegraph Station Heritage Assessment Report, 1995, p 10). 

The number of people killed varies between sources. Some say that although 11 were officially recognised as killed, a higher death toll is likely and others say that 'the number of Aboriginal lives taken in reprisal for the station attack was between 50 and 90, possibly higher' (Nettelbeck & Foster 2007, p 7; Bell 1983, p 63). 

One man put the figure at about 90 at Skull Creek alone (Reid 1990, pp 64-65). Kimber (1991, p 6) noted that 'MJ O'Reilly, who ""got to know a member of this tribe"" in c 1919, understood from the Aborigines that the telegraph station had greatly offended them because it had been built ""on one of the tribe's most sacred spots""'. 

Still later, TGH Strehlow, as a result of discussions with  Aboriginal people in the region,  suggested that 'white men of bad character', not of the telegraph station staff, had abducted young Aboriginal women and raped them; in retaliation the Aborigines attacked the white men available to them rather than the actual criminals (Strehlow cited in Kimber 1991, p 6). 

'As old-timer Alec Ross related many years later, the response was swift: ""They sent out messages on the wires everywhere, and the police and parties of men came up from The Tennant and The Alice and from lots of other places. And I can tell you, they did some pretty serious shooting too – taught the blacks a lesson they've never forgotten… and for quite a few more months blacks would get shot in twos and threes in the whole of this district.

The blacks had been sticking up cattle and had attacked Figg and Coombs [sic]…Those blacks were all the same tribe. Those in pursuit were out scouting and they found out that this mob was up on the hill, camped up on the top of the hill.

They were trapped and the whole lot were shot as they could not get away' (Trish Lonsdale Collection, Reel 22, Side 2, p b10). Both Anna's Reservoir and Attack Gap were under lease by the Willowie Pastoral Company, which was managed by William (Billy) Coulthard. It is likely that this party was headed by Coulthard. Kimber (1991, p 14) wrote: 'Another attack, and follow up punitive expedition, occurred 15 kilometres south west of Alice Springs at a site later known as Attack Gap. An old mate of mine, the late Walter Smith, told me that the Aborigines had attacked a supply wagon, driving off the teamsters (they cut the traces and rode the wagon horses into Alice Springs) and then taking all of the supplies. This immediate success was short-lived, for the largest party of whites ever assembled then rode out. One of the patrol members was later to recall: ""[We] went a bit too far. It was the biggest fight we ever had up here. We made a tidy mob when we all got together...about twenty all told - eight or nine cattle men, some of the chaps from the Overland Telegraph an' a mob of police from the Alice.

Harry Figg (stockman) and Thomas Coombes (cook) were attacked at Anna's Reservoir Homestead, which was owned by the Willowie Pastoral Company headed up by William (Billy) Coulthard. Attackers crept into Coombes' room and speared him eight times then set the roof alight. Figg emerged from the homestead, shooting four dead, before being speared between the shoulders. Both were wounded and badly burnt. They escaped to a stock camp 50 miles away and survived (Traynor, 2016, pp 120-121). The attack on Figg and Coombes took place on August 7 (South Australian Advertiser, 11 Aug 1884  p 4). The attack was carried out by Anmatjere people in an attempt to drive colonists away from their land. 
<br>
One reprisal party was headed by Mounted Constable William Willshire. Willshire, with Constable Charlie Brookes, two Aboriginal trackers and four volunteers (Alec Ross, Harry Price, Summard and McBeth) set off in pursuit of the attackers, reporting that they had had three encounters with groups of Aboriginal people involving shooting, on 29 August, 5 September and 7 September, and killed a total of four (named) Anmatjere men (Adelaide Observer, 20 Sep 1884, p 31). 
<br>
A second reprisal party was led by Mounted Constable Thomas Daer (Adelaide Observer, 20 Sep 1884, p 31). It is thought that Daer's party was involved in the subsequent Blackfellows Bones Bore massacre. Justice Olney noted in 1993: 'In the late nineteenth century the killing of livestock by Aborigines on Undoolya and surrounding areas resulted in a massacre of Aborigines at Itarlentye in the Harts Range. The place is remembered by whites as ""Blackfellows Bones Bore"". In about 1890, CJ Dashwood, the Government Resident at Darwin, drafted a Bill to stop the slaughter of Aboriginal people, the ""Blackfellows Bones"" massacre being but one example. The Bill was blocked by the Legislative Council, the sentiment being that the development of, and pursuit of commercial profit from, the land could not proceed unless Aborigines were ""subdued""' (Olney 1993, pp 8-9). 
<br>
Charles Perkins (1975, p 19) also referred to it: 'There are two good examples amongst the many hundreds that one could choose to illustrate the atrocities that were carried out by white society through the police. A massacre took place at an area called ""Blackfellows Bones"" near Mt Riddock (just north of Alice Springs) which involved the shooting of Aborigines by police. The people who were involved were mainly from Mum's own family, including her mother, her mother's sister, and a number of aunts and uncles. Mum's mother was very young at that time. She managed to escape but her sister was captured. An Aboriginal mother was shot while still bearing a child and carrying another child in her arms. An Aboriginal boy was shot next to her also. There were an unknown number of Aboriginal people killed in this incident which was in retaliation for cattle which were speared by some other Aboriginal people in another area.' 
<br>
Ken Tilmouth Penangk, an Anmatyerr man, recounted an oral history that seems to refer to this massacre, 'The people ran into lots of other Aboriginal men, but it was too late. And right there the whitefellas started shooting. The men tried in vain to defend themselves with their spears. They didn't know anything about guns. They thought that they were like spears. They fled in fear, but the whitefellas chased them and kept shooting. They ran them down with their horses. There would have been more men for Ilkewartn and Atwel countries, but the poor things were shot out. My father's father and my mother's father were shot, the poor things. The young fellas kept on running – they ran a really long way. But some of the whitefellas kept on traveling on and shooting. Some hid in caves, but they were shot inside the caves. They were finished off right there, the poor buggers. Two of my grandfathers were there inside a cave and they were both shot. ... The bones of the dead were spread everywhere. You can see them everywhere – they didn't bury the dead. Nothing. They just left them lying out in the open. Poor things. They were left lying there just like bullocks. All the shields and things were out in the open' (Penangk in Bowman 2015, pp 91-92).",-23.06,134.48,1884-08-07,1884-09-22,"Bowman, 2015, pp 91-92 <a  href=""https://www.clc.org.au/every-hill-got-a-story/"">https://www.clc.org.au/every-hill-got-a-story/</a>; Olney, 1993, pp 8-9; Perkins, 1975, p 19; <i>Adelaide Observer</i>, 20 September 1884, p 31 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/160101265/18940147"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/160101265/18940147</a>; Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory, 2002, pp i, ii, 1 <a href=""https://depws.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/249038/annas_pom.pdf"">https://depws.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/249038/annas_pom.pdf</a>; The South Australian Advertiser, 11 Aug 1884, p 4 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/35965489/2214273""> https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/35965489/2214273</a>.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=931,2024-06-01 00:06:21,2024-11-17 15:29:54,931,"Anmatyerr, Arrernte",SA,NT,Alice Springs,22 September 1884,Morning,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,75,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Police,Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),***,Harry Figg and Thomas Coombes at Anna's Reservoir,,Itarlentye,,"1884: Anna's Reservoir, NT",,19,10,5,Central Desert,Early,Central Desert: Early,Centre,North
299,td0cbb,1336,Mount Sonder,Site,"Mounted Constable Erwein Wurmbrand and trackers Dick, Jemmy, Tommy, Charley and two settlers, William Craigie and James Norman, went to Glen Helen station in response to complaints about the attempted murder of three Glen Helen employees,  Messrs McDonald, Schleicher and Miller. At Hermannsberg mission station, three suspects were taken into custody, chained by the neck.  En route back to Glen Helen they allegedly tried to escape, Wurmbrand reporting that  the 'prisoners are dead'. The party continued on to Mount Sonder where four Aboriginal men were shot dead.  No arrests were made. Camps were destroyed.
Wilson (2000, p 273) wrote that 'The party then returned to Alice Springs where Wurmbrand made much of the shortage of rations that caused him to abandon the patrol rather than the deaths of his suspects. 
Another interpretation has been put on these deaths. H.J. Schmiechen tells how a missionary from Hermannsburg, Schwarz, hearing that the men had been shot, searched for and located the bodies still in their chains. Schwarz argued that ""this made the troopers excuse that they [the Aborigines] were attempting an escape seem highly inadequate for the severe action he had taken.""' Roberts (2005, p 113) wrote: 'On another occasion, Wurmbrand claimed that he shot one man and wounded others at the foot of Mount Sonder, but a station hand who was with him told the missionaries that seventeen Aboriginals had been shot dead.' Traynor (2016, p 122) wrote, 'So his [Willshire's] newly arrived replacement Erwein Wurmbrand rode out to Glen Helen on 12 November with two white men, William Craig and James Norman, and four black trackers. James McDonald and Theodor Schleicher from the station joined them. Wurmbrand seized four Aboriginal men at Hermannsburg on 1 December but released one when the missionaries vouched for him. He chained the other three by the neck and took them up the Finke where he and his men shot them. He went on to pursue other suspects and reported shooting four more near  Mount Sonder.' And Kimber (1990, p 15) made this observation, 'When one considers all of the official reports, independent accounts and strongly circumstantial evidence of punitive expeditions which occurred in 1884-1885 in Anmatjera territory, the early Aboriginal success in their attack on Anna's Reservoir was certainly but a pyrrhic victory. I find no reason to disbelieve Spencer and Gillen's observation that as a result of this initially successful attack the Anmatjera were ""nearly wiped out.""' Traynor (2016, p 123-24) noted that William 'Bill' Benstead of the Willowrie Pastoral Company and a stockman named Lennon joined Wumbrand, each corroborating the figure of 17.",-23.58,132.578,1884-12-01,1884-12-21,"Nettelbeck, 2004, pp 190-206; Nettelbeck & Foster, 2007, pp 34-35; Wilson, 2000, p 273; Roberts, 2005, p 113; Traynor, 2016, p 122, 123-24; Kimber, 1990, p 15.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1068,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,1068,Arrernte,SA,NT,Alice Springs,13 December 1884,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,17,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Mounted Police,Horse,Opportunity,Firearm(s),***,Alleged attempted murder.,"men, women and children",Rwetyepme,,,,19,10,5,Central Desert,Early,Central Desert: Early,Centre,North
83,td0df1,1336,Owen Springs,Site,"Alec Ross, Manager of Undoolya Station from 1880, wrote in <i>The Register</i>, (Adelaide) in 1928 (p 6): 'The same trouble was experienced at Owen Springs and all the places mentioned on the Finke. We petitioned to the South Australian Government to allow the police officer at Alice Springs to organize a body of black trackers to assist the trooper in stopping the cattle killers. This was granted, and six of the best boys from southern stations were placed under MC Wurmbrandt who had them well drilled in a short time. It had a wholesome effect, and cattle killing came to an end. I have known the blacks in those days to spear 13 head of cattle at Simpson's Gap, and never took a steak off any of them. To my knowledge, they were never cruelly treated by the whites. It was the custom to kill cattle frequently for the natives, hoping that this would prevent them from spearing so many on the run. It had no effect, as they seemed determined to drive every settler out of the country, but in the native police — like the old saying, ""Set a rogue to catch a rogue"" — they found that there was no getting away from these boys, and they soon became quiet and useful.' 

Sid Stanes (Trish Lonsdale Collection, Reel 22 side 2), an old Central Australian stockman, said this in an oral history: 'When they killed Harry Figg out there [1884, Anna's Reservoir] they brought all the stock in from Frew River, The Reservoir, The Stirling, they shot a lot too.

205,td0d63,1336,Elkedra,Site,"In her PhD thesis (2006) on the life of Alexander Donald (Pwerle) Ross, Whitebeach interviewed a descendant, Don Ross, who said: 'Old Frank MacDonald, old Scotsman, was with [the other] mob, with the Coulthards, those brothers. They went to Elkedra, that mob. A thousand cattle each, I think they had. Frank MacDonald worked out there at Elkedra for a while. Alyawarr lived out there. They'd kill you, all right, so they [white cattlemen] used to shoot them [Alyawarr]. He [Frank MacDonald] used to see them coming down with the firestick. They were looking for him, to kill him. And I said, ""Did you shoot at 'em'?"" He said, ""Did I? I threaded the bastards, just like putting thread through a needle"". He got through the lot, he reckoned. He stopped a while [at Elkedra], then drifted away from there. He was gone by the time Riley and Kennedy had Elkedra' (Ross cited in Whitebeach, p 175).
Groom, cited in Bell (1978, p 36, fn 12), said: 'In the 1880s, the Willowie Pastoral Company took up the lease at Elkedra. The station was abandoned after an incident with the local Aborigines which convinced the manager that he was not welcome within their country.' William (Billy) Coulthard was the Manager of Elkedra in the Frew River region for the Willowie Pastoral Co.  
Trish Lonsdale's oral history interview with Bill Riley (Reel 3) includes: 'He [Billy Coulthard] was greatly impressed with the Frew River and the reason they left there was the blacks were too bad and any cattle they did not kill – and they did not kill them to eat, either…The blacks were trying to hunt them out of the country. In fact, old Billy [Coulthard] had more boomerang marks on him than any blackfella I have seen. The blacks were trying to murder them. …The reason they left there was on account of the blacks…they sent in a report to their company and there was only one thing to do and that was to start to shoot, but the Willowie Pastoral Company decided that rather than resort to murder they would abandon the whole project.

24,td0ce6,1336,Ryan's Well,Site,"Ryan's Well was sunk as a stock well in 1889 by Ned Ryan's team who had a contract with the SA Water department, hence the name. The date of this massacre is unclear, but is referred to by Pastor Friedrich Wilhelm Albrecht, who arrived in Central Australia in 1926, in these terms (1981, pp5-6): 'Still, off and on, we found quite old people, perhaps 70 or 80 years of age, yet still able to walk quite long distances. During the winter months, we sometimes found whole groups with a cough. After they had come to know that we had medicine better than their witch doctors had to offer, they lined up soon after we had arrived at a camp, asking for medicine. One morning, after most of the people had received a dose of Fryars Balsam in a little water, one tall, strong man came up. Looking in the medicine glass, into which I put some drops the medicine which made the (illegible) curdle, he hesitated. Then, after looking at me very intently, he piped up ""Might be paason (meaning poison)"". I replied: ""Him poison alright."" Another intense look, when I tried to remain as unmoved as possible, he continued: ""Me takem all same."" This little incident is related to show how these primative [sic] people had gained confidence quickly with white people, even if some of them had been with white people and had made some unpleasant and in the case of the Ryans Well massacre, even horrifying experiences.'

252,td0df4,1336,Frew River,Site,"From an oral history with Sid Stanes (Trish Lonsale Collection, Reel 15, side 1, p 50), about Frew River Station: 'They were not there more than 2 or 3 years I don't think. Had a great stockade round the place. Eventually the blacks hunted them out. They used to shoot the blacks, of course, but there were too many of them…they built this bloody high stockyard right round the place and they had a lot of dogs, Bloodhounds, tied up at night around the place…'. 

Bell (1983, p 65) noted: 'The presence of eight Aboriginal women at the Frew River Station was mentioned by the <i>Adelaide Observer</i> (11 July 1891) as one possible reasons for the attack of June 1891 by Alyawarra and Wakaja. Further attacks occurred and by 1896 the ill-fated station was abandoned. Eylmann wrote ""The station dwellers are said to have always treated the Aborigines with the greatest severity and mercilessly shot down every cattle thief they could get hold of. When I was there, I found two human skulls in one piece, one which was pierced by a bullet…"". Aboriginal attacks were kept at bay by the ""ferocity of a large number of kangaroo and blood hounds which were kept inside the palisades"".' 

<i>The Evening Journal</i> (6 July 1891, p 2) reported the event: 'So the blacks on the Frew River have made an attack on Mr. Coulthard and his men. This is just what was expected, and as preparations were made for a visit of this sort, I warrant they got a warm reception...an attack such as that which is reported to have taken place on June 24 was fully expected. When the Willowie Pastoral Company took possession the first thing Mr. Giles wisely insisted upon doing—before putting up any buildings—was to build a barricade consisting of posts slanting outwards. The inside station buildings are inside this'. 

Trish Lonsdale's notes of her interview with Harry Tilmouth read: 'In the Frew River ones, he described to me that Bill Coulthard came in unexpectedly from the camp to the station which had a picket fence all round and they had some dogs that they used to let loose and the cook was the only person there and these natives knew that the cook was there alone. The dogs were very restless and at midnight, Coulthard got up as he felt that there was something wrong and he saw the lubra, there was a lubra helping in the Station, she was assistant to the cook, and she was talking finger [sign] language and Coulthard found looking through his glasses another native on a hill doing likewise, this I think was before dusk. It was later at midnight that the dogs were restless and this finger language aroused his suspicions and then about midnight when the dogs became noisy he took out his guns, revolver and shotgun, and found outside about 30 or more natives with their fire sticks all round the outside of the barricade waiting to attack. He fired amongst them and they scattered. Later when Wurmbrand was on the scene and they were tracking them, in fact they were tracking one another, the natives were tracking the white men and the white men were tracking the natives. They got to the stage where the white men doubled back on their tracks. The natives always attacked at dawn. The white man never camped on his dinner camp at night. They always moved on and camped. This time, they doubled back on their tracks about half a mile. In the early hours of the morning the natives were coming up following the tracks and waiting for them on the double track. They got them all. They later came across some lubras and children and Wurmbrand said, ""They are our enemies; they must go"". Coulthard said ""No, let's take them back to the station"". Wurmbrand said: ""No. They are our enemies"". And they went to a man. The same thing happened out at the Reservoir. They got down onto a waterhole and they were destroyed' (Tilmouth cited in Trish Lonsdale Collection, Reel 26, p 19).

268,td0df2,1336,Ooratippra Station,Site,"William Coulthard's diary of 1903 (Coulthard, 1903) makes frequent references to a band of Aboriginal people killing horses and cattle around Ruby Gap (pp 23, 27, 37, 44, 45, 47, 93, 117, 118-121, 125, 126). On March 13 Coulthard first heard of the horse killing from Harding, who reported 2 Aboriginal people had stolen a rifle and cartridges and that the troopers had failed to apprehend them (Coulthard, 1903, p 33).
<br>
In a letter on March 29th, Coulthard wrote that 'Albert has gone out with the trooper & their niggers to catch those other two that are killing horses & cattle as soon as any of the horses make back there these niggers kill them, they are getting quite plucky now as they think the whites are frightened of them, they told some of the other niggers to tell the whites to come & catch them & they will shoot the first one they see, they are saving cartridges to do it, they went down to Prossers place joins Uncle on the East & took all his flour & rations, he came into Arltunga in a great way, but Albert only laughed at the idea of getting shot, he went away prepared for three weeks trip, he says his nigger Sam will track them until he gets them as he has got a set on one of them, one of them is the ringleader that used to kill Uncles horses before, the blacks killed two others themselves, as they reckoned they were the cause of loosing so many friends through the horse filling business.' (Coulthard, 1903, pp 119-120)
<br>
On April 1, Coulthard complained of the ineffectiveness of the troopers, and stated he and Albert would have a 'nigger hunt' without them, 'I heard in there that Albert & the trooper came back Monday from hunting those niggers, they found where they had killed two, but they were Hardings & not Uncles so they could do nothing had to come back for Harding to take out a Warrent for them what rot, they tracked them a good day & they were making towards Uncles country so we have a nigger hunt all to ourselves when we go out there mustering' (Coulthard, 1903, pp 44-45)
<br>
On April 29 Coulthard wrote about the high cost the horse killing had, 'After we have gone through the horse muster they will know if they have enough for Adelaide & they will start in August with them to get down in September, so if you can get on without me till then I will stop & help them down, poor beggars they need a bit of help for instead of having a 1000 horses as they ought to, they have only about 400, what with the niggers & the drought. After we have finished the horses, Uncle is going out to Irratippara the station they had before where the niggers killed all the horses,' (Coulthard, 1903, p125) and the fear that they causes, 'Walkington & the other fellow are going out to Uncles old station I have always called it Irratipperaa it is Orratippera prospecting & to look for some of his horses that are out there he used to be with Uncle on the Frew so he came to see if Uncle would go with them as a lot of his have gone back, & they are frightened the niggers will get them. so he is going with them' (Coulthard, 1903, p126)
<br>
On July 16, Coulthard encountered a group 20 Aboriginal warriors around Ruby Gap, 'After we had gone 5 or 6 miles we met about 20 wild niggers, they told the boys thev were going into Paddys hole to have a fight with the niggers in there, they were quite naked & had spears & Boomerangs & all sorts of Arms they looked a bit savage, they onlv stopped a few minutes talking to the boys then went on, we could see their track all the way to Ruby Gap, & we came across their fire near a waterhole, we got to the yards a little before Sundown, but too late to look round for horses, so we made our camp, & I wrote up this before I made the tea, had tea, got some bushes for a breakwind, made my bed & lay down on it. This is the time to make you think when you are all by yourself, & away out in the wild parts, I got mv rifle Uncles at least & put 6 cartridges in it, & lay it along side of me, then turned in about 7.' (Coulthard, 1903, pp 98)
<br>
Sid Stanes, an old Central Australian stockman, said in an oral history, 'Then they went to Orratrippera [sic] and took up that, Coulthard and Wallis. Eventually the blacks killed 60 or 70 horses in one gap in the ranges there and the water was all in the ranges you see, springs. The stock used to go into water and the niggers used to get each side of the range. And as they came along bowl them out. The nigs cleaned up 60-80 horses. After Coulthard and Wallis cleaned up all the niggers that they could find, one of the boys they had with them, they shot all this mob and there was a kid left in the camp, a little one, one of these niggers got hold of him and banged his head in the ground…Then they got cleared out of there and that is when they took up Loves Creek. That is when I was a butcher boy at Arltunga, they came there with about 300 horses to Loves Creek. Undoolya had thrown that up, Paddys Hole and Arltunga, they had previously owned it and they had thrown that part up and only kept the west side of it, Alice Springs and Undoolya, Mt Undoolya, Bitter Springs, Mt Benstead and that is their boundary' (Trish Lonsdale Collection, NTRS 3414/Part 1).",-21.876,136.083,1902-08-01,1902-08-30,"Trish Lonsdale Collection, NTRS 3414/Part 1 – Sid Stanes; Diary of William Coulthard, 1903, NT Library: <a href=""https://territorystories.nt.gov.au/10070/449299/0/0"">https://territorystories.nt.gov.au/10070/449299/0/0</a>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1005,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:53,1005,Alyawarr,SA,NT,Alice Springs,1902,,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,20,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,,Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),**,0,"Men, women and children",Irretety Community Living Area,,,,100,10,5,Central Desert,Mid,Central Desert: Mid,Centre,North
309,td0cdd,1336,The Granites,Site,"Alice Springs historian Dick Kimber wrote: 
'Major Jangala told the following account, which can be dated to 1911-1912. Major learnt it from his father. 
<br>
'A Mounted Policeman with two Native Constables travelled from the Overland Telegraph Line out into Warlpiri country. He arrested six men near the Granites, and commenced the journey back to the Telegraph Line. One Warlpiri man, who had been resting in the shade about 50 to100 metres away when the arrests were made, had crawled and then run away while the arrests were being made, but when sure of his safety then returned and followed the patrol. 
<br>
'He was able to obtain water and camp a short distance off the line of march because he knew the rockholes and soakages of the country. Very occasionally he ""finger-talked"" to the prisoners, suggesting possibilities of escape, but had to be extremely careful, and normally stayed out of sight except at sundown and sunrise.
<br>
'Each night the prisoners were chained to trees with neck-chains, one to a tree so that they could not readily contrive an escape. After a few days the policeman made a decision. He was friendly in manner as he gave each man along an almost straight line of trees some breakfast and a drink of water, and Major envisaged him saying to each prisoner, ""Sorry old man"". When they had finished their meal and drink, he and the Native Constables stood off at a short distance and shot them all. They took the chains off, left the men who were shot for the wedge-tailed eagles, falcons, crows and dingoes, and rode back towards the Overland Telegraph Line.
<br> 
'The man who had been following the group fled, and became the teller of the story.
…
I have no reason whatsoever to doubt Major Jangala's story. I knew him for years, travelled his country with him, and he was a man of strong character and integrity. I therefore do believe that an unknown policeman, not wishing to go through the trouble of long travel with Warlpiri prisoners and a court case, committed murder in the name of rough frontier justice well south-east of The Granites in about 1912' (Alice Springs News, 8 Oct 2003).

Stewart went to water horses at a soak three quarters of a mile from camp.

You know, they didn't know about trousers, don't know clothes. Those naked Anangu they came from the west, came along when there were rations. They started getting rations, clothing, everything. Nowadays they're a bit flash, almost whitefellas. Yes, they sat and ate, naked. They speared a lot of cattle. They didn't understand properly. You know, they were spearing cattle those naked men, long ago. And McNamara, he shot them. Pow! Pow! Long ago, this side of Areyonga. Today they say he shot many. It happened a long time ago. They come from that way, Ayers Rock way was their country"".' 

This is corroborated by Rowse (1998, pp 63-64), who wrote: 'Bowman's memoirs, evidently written in the 1980s, do not reveal him to have been an advocate or practitioner of violence against Indigenous people, but he told Mervyn Hartwig in 1960 that, ultimately, ""good"" relationships had flowed from the shootings around Coniston. Guns are known to have been used in 1921, when the pastoralist McNamara killed an unknown number of people (estimates range from six to twenty-five) at Bowson's Hole – because a milking cow was speared'. From Pearce (cited in Davis and Prescott, 1988, np): 'It was also in about 1921 that McNamara shot a number of Aborigines (between six and 25, according to varying accounts) who had speared one of his milking cows…The incident had a profound effect on the people of the region, and it is still spoken of with awe. There can be little doubt that its disturbing effect was profound at the time'.

388,td0da1,1336,Coniston (1),Site,"In 1928 the region around the Lander River and Hanson River was 5 years into a drought. Few places were left where people and livestock could drink and Aboriginal people were increasingly spearing cattle for food. Prior to the Coniston massacres, colonists complained that Aboriginal people were increasingly audacious or 'cheeky' and it was reported that Aboriginal people known to colonists as 'Warramulla' around Tanami and the Granites goldfields who had gained a reputation for wildness and attacks were planning to drive colonists out of the region (Bradley, 2019, p 2 & Kimber, 2003-2004, Part 1). 
<br>
On 7 August 1928 a group of Warlpiri, Anmatyere and Kaytetye men led by Kamalyarrpa Japananglea, also known as 'Bullfrog', killed dingo trapper Fred Brooks at Yurrkuru, a Warlpiri, Anmatyere and Kaytetye camp about 14 miles (22 km) from the Coniston Station homestead. The killing took place in reprisal for Brooks's kidnapping one of Bullfrog's wives. After his body was found in a rabbit hole, Mounted Constable George Murray, who was a veteran of the Boer War and World War I, led a punitive expedition of eight armed men around the Lander River and among the ranges to the west. The expedition included 'Mounted Constable Murray, Stafford, Saxby, Briscoe, the 'half-caste' Wilson and three Aboriginal trackers, Paddy, Major and Dodger.' (Bradley, 2019, p 51). This expedition lasted 16 days.
On this first expedition the killing started at Coniston on 15th August when two Aboriginal men, Padygar and Willigar, came into the camp armed with boomerangs and spears. Paddy and Major attempted to arrest and chain them, and when they resisted, Murray shot Willigar in the head and Padygar was restrained (Bradley, 2019, pp 43-57). Willigar later died of the wound.
<br>
The following day on 16 August, the expedition departed Coniston and returned on 31 August. Government Resident, J.C. Cawood, reported in a telegram to Canberra that 17 Aboriginal people were killed (Bradley, 2019, p 96). Mounted Constable Murray, later claimed that during this expedition he shot 1 prisoner resisting arrest at Coniston, then he killed 17 Aboriginal people at another camp, 'The firing broke out - I don't know who started it, but the whole 17 were dead when it finished.' Then 50 miles west in the Granites, two more were shot, and a prisoner died on the return journey (Northern Standard, 3 March 1933, p 5). They returned to Coniston with another prisoner, Arkirkra. 
Accounts in court proceedings and from various sources differ slightly in numbers and in the order of events, but these incidents remain consistent. There are also several days unaccounted for (Bradley, 2019, p72) and Aboriginal oral records of the period are specific about where further killings took place, though it is not clear on which expedition they occurred. It's likely those on the Lander as far north as Six Mile Soak and Tipinpa, and to the west were either part of this first or the second expedition. Bradley describes 6 locations where the expedition encountered Aboriginal people, north of Coniston along the Lander River, and westwards to the ranges beyond Cockatoo Springs and present day Yuendumu (Bradley, 2019, p xi & p 122).
<br>
Concluding this expedition, Mounted Constable Murray took the two prisoners, Padygar and Arkirkra, and a witness, a boy named Lala, from Coniston to Alice Springs (Bradley, 2019, p 74).",-21.981,132.271,1928-08-15,1928-08-31,"Woodward, 1973, p 82;  Read & Read, 1991, pp 33-37; Bell 1993, pp 67-68; Toohey 1979; Edmond, 2013, p 104 <a href=""http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/534259"">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/534259</a>; Morrison <a href=""https://www.australianfrontierconflicts.com.au"">www.australianfrontierconflicts.com.au</a>; Schubert, <i>NT News</i>, August 25, 2018, pp 24-25 <a href=""https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-24/nt-police-apologise-for-state-sanctioned-coniston-massacre/10162850"">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-24/nt-police-apologise-for-state-sanctioned-coniston-massacre/10162850</a>; Wilson & O'Brien, 2003, pp 59-78; Bowman, 2015 <a  href=""https://www.clc.org.au/every-hill-got-a-story/"">https://www.clc.org.au/every-hill-got-a-story/</a>;

Kimber (2003, np) wrote that Fred Raggatt, then owner of Glen Helen, discovered that Warlpiri people had killed and butchered one of his draught horses. Raggatt, ""his only long-term mate George [Paddy] Tucker, Archie Giles of neighbouring Redbank station, and [Harry] Tilmouth [part-owner of Napperby Station] had followed their tracks."" The likely number of people estimated by both Kimber and Warlpiri man Dinny Japaltjarri, was 10 to 15. 

He continued: ""…the families took their horse-meat and their fire-sticks into some rock shelters, perched a little way up on a range section west of Central Mount Wedge. Dinny believed that, as the station men approached, a draft of wind had caused the fire-sticks to flare and given their hiding place away. The station men had taken up position among the boulders beneath the rock shelters, from which there was no escape other than coming out into the open. Their rifles had poured the bullets in, and ricocheting bullets had been deadly. After a time the shouts of the men, and the screams of the women and children, ceased.

64,td0da3,1336,Coniston (2),Site,"There is little information about the second Coniston massacre expedition, which occurred over 9 days from 4 September to 13 September, 1928.
<br>
According to Kimber, 'The prospectors Young and Carter, who had met Fred Brooks a few days before his murder, had reported the news of threatening Warlpiri to Sergeant Noblett, who had reported it to Cawood. Michael Terry had told of seeing Walmulla warriors in war-paint; shootings at marauders (without effect) by Randal Stafford and Jack Saxby on the 31st August; and passed on a further appeal from Randal Stafford for urgent assistance in dealing with those who were causing the depredations' (Kimber, 2003-2004, Part 10).
<br>
Almost immediately after delivering the prisoners Padygar and Arkirkra to Alice Springs, Mounted Constable Murray was sent out again, to attend to complaints of cattle theft at Pine Hill, and 'For the period between 4 and 13 September, the list noted only that Murray had ""left Alice Springs to investigate alleged cattle killings at 'Pine Hill' and 'Coniston Stn'"", that he ""returned with two prisoners"" and that he had travelled 395 miles. That is, an average of some 44 miles per day' (Bradley, 2019, p 94).
<br>
Historian Dick Kimber, who knew the area well and had interviewed numerous people in the area, reasoned that this expedition included police trackers Paddy and Major, one or two Pine Hill station volunteers, Randal Stafford, Jack Saxby, Alex Wilson and Billy Briscoe (Kimber, 2003-2004, Part 10). 
<br>
Based on oral accounts, Kimber estimates 7 encounters in which killings are likely to have occurred: 'Oral histories, which can only be approximations in time, indicate that, as might be expected, the patrol travelled north along the Hanson River from Pine Hill, having three encounters; from Coniston travelled north along the Lander River country where two more encounters took place; then followed down the Lander and had two more encounters in the general Coniston area.' He estimates the minimum death toll to have been 12: 'On the basis of two deaths every other encounter, which is the lowest number of deaths at all other encounters, 12 more men are likely to have been shot. Many more are, in fact, likely to have died, but there is absolutely no written account from 1928 to indicate that any at all were shot.'
<br>
The Alice Springs Police Station Day Journal recorded that from this expedition there were two prisoners, Ned and Barney (Bradley, 2019, p93) though they were not later tried for Fred Brooks's murder (Kimber, 2003-2004, Part 10), as were Padygar and Arkirkra.",-21.741,133.669,1928-09-04,1928-09-13,"Woodward, 1973, p 82; Read & Read, 1991, pp 33-37; Bell, 1993, pp 67-68; Toohey 1979; Edmond, 2013, p 104; Morrison <A href=""https://www.australianfrontierconflicts.com.au"">www.australianfrontierconflicts.com.au</a>; Schubert, <i>NT News</i>, August 25, 2018, pp 24-25 <a href=""https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-24/nt-police-apologise-for-state-sanctioned-coniston-massacre/10162850"">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-24/nt-police-apologise-for-state-sanctioned-coniston-massacre/10162850</a>; Wilson & O'Brien, 2003, pp 59-78;

287,td0c98,1336,Coniston (3),Site,"On 8 September, 1928, news emerged that William 'Nugget' Morton had been attacked by Aboriginal people and had barely survived. Nugget Morton was notorious among both colonists and Aboriginal people. He kept many women, and no Aboriginal men, as 'stockmen' at his homestead (Bradley, 2019, pp 86-88). Kimber records that 'His [Alex Wilson's] Halls Creek wife, an attractive young Aboriginal woman, was taken from him by Nugget who, when Alex protested, took up his stock-whip and whipped Alex so badly that he sliced open his back from shoulder to waist.' (Kimber, 2003-2004, Part Two). Having spoken to Nugget Morton in 1937, Strehlow recorded in his diary that, '""Nugget"" was since employing as ""stockmen"" (he has no male abos working for him) one or two other little native girls, 9 or 10 years of age, whom he had raped. Another little girl he had given to his nephew ""Shrimp"", who was about 17 years of age' (Strehlow in Bradley, 2019, p 88).
<br>
Paddy Willis said: 'Well, Nugget Morton gathered up some women and took them to his camp, taking them from the old people. He used to take women... Well, the old people were worried about their women. They gathered together into a fighting group, before attacking Nugget Morton' (Paddy Willis in Bowen, 2015, p 92). 
<br>
According to Nugget's account, the reason he survived the attack was that so many were attacking at once that they were in each other's way and none of them could land a blow. An exceptionally strong man, although injured he fought them off, shot one, and made his way to safety.
<br>
On 16 September, another pastoralist, Tilmouth, had been droving 1500 bullocks between 2 soaks because of the drought and he too was attacked, and survived after shooting an Aboriginal man, Wangaridge (Kimber, 2003-2004, Part Ten and Bradley, 2019, p 114).
<br>
After Mounted Constable Murray returned to Alice Springs from his second clandestine expedition he spent some time at his own station at Barrow Creek, then with Murray, Morton, Wilson and a small Aboriginal boy, embarked on the 3rd Coniston massacre expedition (note that due to the obscurity of the 2nd expedition, some sources refer to the 3rd as the 2nd expedition) over 22 days from 24 September to 15 October.
<br>
In an interview with Ernestine Hill, published in 1933, Mounted Constable Murray said that on this expedition he and Morton captured 3 boys and forced them to guide them: 'Morton and I rode out together secured three boys who were innocent and demanded that they guide us to the guilty group. For three days those boys fooled us, leading us miles to wurlies long abandoned and to dry soaks. They were young initiates and dare not disclose the secrets of the older men. During the night they actually burned their feet to raw blisters and pounded their toes to pulp so that they could not walk. We covered their feet with bags and made them go on - but to no purpose. At last I resorted to a ruse. Taking one of them out of sight, I fired twice into the dust. The other in quivering fright agreed at once to track the offenders' (Mounted Constable Murray in Northern Standard, 3 March 1955, p 5).
<br>
Morton and Murray's statements about what happened were so similar that Bradley (Bradley, 2019, p116) says they had colluded to agree what they would say. They admit to 3 incidents:
First, at Tomahawk Waterhole, 40 or 50 miles north-west of Morton's main camp where 4 were shot. Second, they went back up the Lander to Boomerang Waterhole and to Circle Well and killed two people. Third, on the lower Hanson River Murray and Morton came upon 40 people and killed 8. This totals 14 people killed. There were no prisoners and there was no mention of wounded.
<br>
Mounted Constable Murray's report on 19 Oct, said 'unfortunately a number of natives were killed' (Bradley, 2019, p120). Nugget Morton's attitude towards Aboriginal people is demonstrated in his own words: 'The police hadn't done their job half well enough for my liking; for the Government is always frightened of what the city folks will say when someone wants to teach these bush myalls a decent sort of a lesson... You might think thirty-four niggers to be a fair enough bag. Who knows? There might have been some more. But I'm not satisfied yet by a long way' (Morton to Strehlow in Bradley, 2019, p120).
<br>
Aboriginal accounts of the 'killing times' include more sites than those reported by Murray and Morton. An account from Sonny Curtis Jappanangka, recorded in Bowman (2015, p 90) indicates that the third expedition pursued people beyond the Hanson as far as Kurundi Station: 'All the bad things had been happening at Jarra Jarra, Hanson River way, before I was born... They run away and some stopped at Greenwood [Station] and some kept going to Tennant Creek...  
The police and all, one lady, Kitty Napangardi, showed the police trackers where to go...
Dad was driving the packhorses and somewhere through, Kurundi Station, he was telling me, some of our people were cutting sugarbag by the side of the road, mind their own business hunting. My old man looked over and saw people, and told the woman, 'Don't tell them they are there.' But she did, she went up the front and told the police – and they shot the poor buggers. They were killing anybody, they weren't looking for people that did the damage over there. They were killing anyone, the government people were. Old people who lived along the Hanson Creek, they were happy, then after the shooting they scattered. But I tell you right now, today even, people are still living in the fear. They are not sure of white people, no trust for them still today...' (Sonny Curtis Jappanangka in Bowen, 2015, p 90).",-20.968,133.544,1928-09-24,1928-10-15,"Bowman, 2015, p 90 <a  href=""https://www.clc.org.au/every-hill-got-a-story/"">https://www.clc.org.au/every-hill-got-a-story/</a>;

The initial report of poisoning claimed, 'THE MOUNT IDA BLACKS. To the Editor. - Sir,-I see Mr. Nanson has asked the Premier certain questions re the finding of eight dead blacks a mile from the Ida H battery. I think the Minister should refer Mr. Nanson to reports of the Coroner, Mr. Campbell Shaw, who is one of the straightest men in the Commonwealth; Dr. Pritchard, one of the best surgeons living; and the police of Laverton, who are as good men as police can be. 'If those blacks have been poisoned it must have been accidentally. They have possibly raided some poor beggar's camp and got something more to eat than they bargained for. I have known one of those eight niggers for years, and a dirtier, begging, lazy, thieving, and would-be murdering lot never crawled Australia.

	An investigation by Mr C F Gale found that circumstances related to the alleged poisoning could not be substantiated, but that there was evidence of attacks by spears and nullas. Aboriginal people questioned claimed the attack had been by a rival Aboriginal group and other witnesses had seen the rival group in the area. 'I examined the native woman who identified the bodies of the deceased, and other natives who were in town, and closely questioned them as to the cause of the death of their friends. They all unhesitatingly stated that some Darlot natives had killed them, although I tried to put their thoughts into a groove of suspicion that death was caused otherwise, they were all very positive that the natives were killed by spearing at the hands of some Darlot tribe, and I was absolutely unable to shake their statement.'

208,td0d6e,1336,"Thouringowa Waterhole, Bulloo River, Bullawarra, Thargomindah",Site,"In September 1865 reports emerged that John Dowling of Paroo in the Warrego District had been murdered by his Aboriginal assistant and guide, Waddy Galo, of the Buela River and that Mr William Hall and Mr George Podmore with an Aboriginal assistant had tracked them to where they found his body with his belongings and with his skull crushed (Sydney Mail, 2 Sep, 1865, p 4).
<br>
Long after the event, in 1922, E.O. Hobkirk claimed to have been at a massacre led by John Dowling's brother, Vincent Dowling, and attempted to sell his story for 10 shillings at the Home Secretary's Office. He wrote:
<br>
'When Mr Vincent Dowling heard the sad news, he was very math [sic] as well as may be expected and cut up. 
A short time after he received the sad tidings, he came  to Thouringowa Station. I was informed that he (Mr 
Dowling) had written to the Queensland government authorities concerning the murder and the reply was ""to 
take whatever measures he thought best to revenge the murder"" as there were no Native Police at that time in the District 
to see to the matter. 
<br>
The following procedure was adopted. All the men in the neighbourhood who were available and willing (not 
including myself) were banded together, armed with revolvers and rifles, set out to revenge the blacks' camp, 
which was close to the homestead and when doing so there they found belonging [sic] of the murdered man consisting of 
his hat, coat, blankets, tomahawk, sheath knife etc. 
<br>
Mr V Dowling who could talk the blacks' lingo pretty well asked several of them ""who killed white fellah? 
brother belonging to me."" They one and all answered ""they knew nothing about the murder."" He also enquired, 
""Where Pimpilly."" This they also confessed ""that they knew nothing whatever about him."" Mr Dowling then said, ""If 
you do not tell me, I will shoot the lot of yous."" Still they all remained silent. Mr Dowling and the others, then set 
to work and put an end to many of them not touching the lubras and young fry. This I know is true as I helped 
first to burn the bodies and then to bury them. A most unpleasant undertaking but as I was only a jackaroo on 
Cheshunt station at the time, I had to do what I was told. Later in the day the party went to another camp of blacks 
about 20 miles down the river and there again shot about the same number. 
<br>
After the massacre, the whole tribe of blacks left the river frontage and that locality and went miles away out 
in the ranges and elsewhere. We found it hard to prevent the few that were employed on the stations from doing 
likewise as they were so scared at what had taken place that we had to lock them up in the hut that was used as
a store for a short time. For many months there was not A single black to be seen for miles around excepting 
the few already mentioned among these was an elderly man who was deaf and dumb' (Hobkirk in Dillon, 2019, pp 108-110).
<br>
Although arguing against the veracity of details reported in this massacre, Dillon has researched and published many relevant sources (Dillon, 2019).
Hobkirk also tried to sell other stories, and Dillon highlights many discrepancies in details between his stories and other evidence. As Hobkirk was an old man recalling an event after 57 years and is trying to sell his story we should expect some details to be misremembered or exaggerated. None the less, it is most likely that his story has some basis in real events. Hobkirk's story begins with a verifiable event - the killing of John Dowling. 

<br>
As well as the full text of Hobkirk's story, Dillon provides sources on a controversy in the press prior to John Dowling's murder that provides important context. In 1864 and 1865, a series of letters were published in newspapers beginning with a claim made by a correspondent referred to as 'Bourke' in 1864 that Mr Dowling had been killed by Aboriginal people (Dillon, 2019, pp 95-103). 

About a year prior to the murder of John Dowling an article appeared stating that 'Mr Dowling, son of Judge Dowling' had been murdered along with three or four of his men. This appears to refer to either Vincent or John Dowling, though no first name was used, as their father was a judge. According to this article 3 or 4 men were murdered with Dowling and the Native Police and colonists were 'stuck up' and held under siege at Thom's station by Aboriginal people. Another group of Native Police came to reinforce them after 'dispersing' Aboriginal people at Tooth's run (<i>The Armidale Express and New England General Advertiser</i>, 25 Jun 1864, p 4)

This was contradicted by Vincent Dowling, who wrote that he was alive and that 'The blacks on the Paroo are the quietest I know in the colonies' (<i>Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser</i>, 12 July, 1864, p 3). 'Bourke' replied that it was a shepherd also named 'Dowling' who had been killed (<i>Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser</i>, 9 August, 1864, p 3). The exchange then focuses on whether the region is safe or dangerous, with Vincent Dowling arguing that '...many of those paragraphs are not only untrue in themselves, but calculated to seriously injure the character of the district... The Warrego district, which is, without exception one of the largest and most valuable possessed by Queensland, is not the lawless state your correspondent would evidently lead your readers to believe... I have no hesitation in asserting that the blacks are, as a body, perfectly inoffensive, quiet, and well disposed... This immunity from crime will, I think, convince every impartial member of the community that in this far distant portion of the Queensland territory there is greater security both for life and property than in any part of New South Wales...' (<i>Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser</i>, 1 April, 1865, p 5) Bourke's response stated that Mr Dowling (the shepherd) and others had died and lists the names of five men who had died of thirst, adding, 'And your correspondent did his duty in warning travellers against coming into this waterless country... We are only working men; but we read the papers, and know what is the truth and what is the untruth.' The letter from 'Bourke' is signed by 6 men of the Warrego River (<i>Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser</i>, 6 June, 1865, p 3).
<br>
From other news it appears that Vincent Dowlings was misrepresenting the situation. There was a drought in the region. It affected some more than others (<i>The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser</i>, 7 Dec 1865, p 4) but was bad enough to force some pastoralists off their runs (The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser, 14 Sep 1865, p 3). Vincent Dowling seems to be no exception to the hardships in the region as 
Maxwell's short biography of Dowling says that, 'During his life in the far west it may be said that he fought with nature to achieve success. Many times he suffered agonies from thirst, on one occasion having been for seventy hours without water, and then just getting back to the settlement when at the last stage and almost dying. His knowledge of articles of food is very extensive, having been acquired under the pressure of starvation' (Maxwell, 1889, p 386).
<br>
Pastoralists in the Warrego were keen to sell parts of their runs which they could not fully utilise (Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald and General Advertiser, 9 Jul 1868 p 3). This is probably why Vincent Dowling was concerned over the reputation of the region and motivated to portray it favourably. Contrary to Vincent's claims, there was conflict with Aboriginal people in the region. That Vincent's own brother John Dowling was murdered by his Aboriginal servant in 1865 (after the correspondence around Dowling the shepherd being killed) belies his insistence that the region was safe. Two articles calling for more protection from the Native Police show that, far from being peaceful, in 1864 and 1865 there was conflict between Aboriginal people and colonists including murders and stock raids:
<br>
'Information has just reached Brisbane, by a gentleman whose veracity is unimpeachable, that two shepherds of Mr. Cameron's, a father and his son, have been very recently murdered on a creek which runs nearly midway between and parallel with the Mungalarla and the Angelarla
Creeks and from the same source I learn that a flock of sheep belonging to Messrs. Humphries and Bullmore, on the Ward river, had been taken from a shepherd, and before they could be rescued from the blacks over 130 had been killed, and that the blacks were getting very
troublesome all over the district. These outrages, I believe, result more from the way in which the Native Police are distributed
throughout the western districts, than from any want of more police or officers. The Warrego is a very remote and large district, and
the aborigines cannot be depended on in any part of it for the protection of life and property' (The Brisbane Courier, 9 Dec 1864 p 2).
<br>
Another article states: 
'That this district has received no protection from the hostile natives - with which it swarms - except a small force of native police, under Lieutenant Lambert, who, although a very meritorious officer, finds it impossible with his force to guard efficiently a district extending in length to 500 miles' (The Age, 20 Apr 1865, p 5). 

<br>
This is important context as the stress on resources created by drought, Aboriginal resistance and conflict including murders and stock theft, and the killing of Vincent's brother amount to a situation similar to events leading up to many other massacres throughout the history of frontier conflict in Australia. It also corresponds with Hobkirk's statement that Vincent and other colonists proceeded without police assistance as there were no Native Police available in the area, bearing in mind that although Native Police were sometimes active in the area, the complaint was that they were too few and too remote to be adequate.
<br>
In 1888 Charles F Maxwell wrote in a biography of Vincent Dowling that, 'Although exposed to frequent attacks from the blacks, he escaped without hurt, but not without some close shaves, as on one occasion he had a spear driven through his hat; and on another a boomerang thrown by a wild man cut open the ribs of the mare he was riding. Yet he did not retaliate, and not until 1865, when his brother John was murdered by the blacks, did he ever shed a drop of blackfellow's blood' (Maxwell, 1889, v1, p 185).
<br>
According to Hazel McKellar in <i>Matyu-mundu</i> one of these massacres is recorded in Kullilla oral history, 'Some whites say these people belonged to the ""Bitharra"" tribe but Peter Hood, a Kullilla descendant, is certain they were his people. He says the site of this massacre was further south towards Bulloo Downs' (McKellar, 1984, p. 57). This is most likely the second massacre mentioned by Hobkirk which he said was further south (See <a href=""https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1108"">Bulloo Downs</a>).
<br>
Various later accounts of this massacre claim the death toll of these massacres was as high as 300 (Bottoms 2013, p64). An estimate of 30 killed at each campsite is thus conservative. Although details may be uncertain it is most likely that the massacres described by Hobkirk and recorded in Kullilla oral history occurred.",-28.196,143.339,1865-01-01,1865-12-31,"Sydney Mail, 2 Sep, 1865 <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/16551220'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/16551220</a>;

Going to their aid in a party, Alaric Ward shot an Aboriginal man and the Aborigines retreated. Col BT Finniss, who was in charge of the settlement, appointed his son Frederick as the head of a mounted and foot party. 'As they set out on 8 September eastwards towards Chambers Bay, William McMinn, who had charge of the foot party, asked Frederick Finniss what was to be done. Young Finniss replied: ""Shoot every bloody native you see"". When asked later by the royal commission whether he understood that the orders implied an indiscriminate massacre of the natives, McMinn replied: ""Everyone could interpret the orders in his own way"". He could see ""from the feeling coming from them"" that his men would slaughter the Aborigines. Three of them trapped an Aborigine behind some scrub and, instead of taking him prisoner, one of them shot him dead. The whites then went to the native camp, recovered stolen property and destroyed the camp. They then encountered the surveyor, JWO Bennett, who ""ordered them not to kill a native within fifty yards of his camp"", apparently because he feared the Aborigines would associate him with this action. It was too late; they had already done so. 'When the party returned to Escape Cliffs, Finniss complimented his son by saying, ""Well done, Freddy, I thought you would let them see"". Some time later, Alaric Ward was out of the whites' camp and was killed by the natives' (Reid 1990, pp 32-33). 
Finniss, responding to F Rymill during the <i>Northern Territory Commission of Inquiry</i>, said: 'The government had sent the party to occupy their territory without regard to their wishes, and if we were to remain there we were to overcome their hostility; and this, as we had proved, could not be done by means of conciliation and forebearance' (cited in Reid p 34).",-12.148,131.266,1864-09-08,1864-08-13,"Reid, 1990; Austin, 1992; SA Parliament Northern Territory Commission of Inquiry, 1866.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=999,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:54,999,Woolna,SA,NT,Military settlement,1864,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,10,Aboriginal,Colonists,1,Military,"Foot, Horse",Reprisal,Firearm(s),***,Reprisal for pilfering the camp.,,,,,Alaric Ward,57,29,3,Daly and Mary River,Early,Daly and Mary River: Early,North,North

During the same afternoon several niggers visited Newman's battery, and on Monday morning a lot of tools were missing.

And a response: 'There may be occasions on which firmness is absolutely necessary with the natives, when they must be taught that the whitefellow is master and not to be trifled with; but to hunt them down to endeavor to make them prisoners; to break their jaws with the fist of a giant; to wound them in the shoulders with bullets from a revolver, and then let them escape into the bush to suffer pain and agony for weeks is the very way to make them troublesome and dangerous in the bush and on the road (WSN cited in, <i>NTTG</i> 30 Jan 1874, p 3). And this: 'The niggers are still prowling and crawling about and around the camps. Even at nights they are to be met with; it is not safe to go to the swamp for water to work on the claims; or to stop to mind the tents singly without being fully armed and prepared for an attack from them; and this state of things is likely to remain until someone is murdered by them, and the miners —in defiance of their sympathiser at Pine Creek—are driven to take the law in their own hands, and effectually hunt them down' (Correspondent cited in <i>NTTG</i> 19 Jun 1874, p 3). This was written in 1878: 'I should not be surprised if there is a little more shooting before long, but whatever is done I trust that the parties concerned will not blow about their exploits but hold their tongues ""Speech is silver, but silence is gold!""'

His party included Charles Levi, George Reid, Jack Crossman, Ling Ah Hoo, an Aboriginal man named Prince from Port Essington, and Neddie Lewis. John Lewis (1922, pp 141-144) takes up the commentary: 'Levi and I made through the reeds to the open plain, where the horses were. We found them surrounded by between sixty to seventy armed natives, with spears ready for action, who, as soon as they saw us, ran together and formed a very formidable body. Yelling and dancing, they rushed towards us and threw their spears… Fortunately none touched us. We knew that if we turned the natives would chase and probably overpower us, and the only thing to do was to shoot at them, which we did. Many of them were hit, although we could not be sure that any of them were fatally wounded. We shot twenty-one rounds, and then had only our revolvers left. They stood their ground, so we charged, and when they saw us coming they disappeared behind some reeds. When we let our horses go and formed our camp the natives came down from the hills on the eastern side in great numbers. We had six staghounds, which we tied to pegs driven in the ground to keep them from chasing the natives, who came nearer and nearer until they got within about 150 yards. Then they threw spears. Meantime we had taken up positions behind our packsaddles and arranged a good supply of bullets, which were nicely greased. The Chinaman had a double-barrelled gun loaded with buck-shot. The natives kept encroaching until they got near to send a shower of spears over us (many of which stuck in our baggage), and then we fired. We kept up fire for a long time, and many of them were injured. These were taken away by the lubras, who made a hideous row. We maintained fire for nearly half an hour, and then they retreated. We finished cooking our turkey, and had a most enjoyable meal....[next day] I turned round to see the rest [of the men in the party] come through, when I heard Levi cry ""Look out!"" Then I saw a shower of spears falling around me. Fortunately, I was close under the cliff, and out of reach of the spears; and although many fell around the Chinaman and Levi, and two touched the ammunition pack, nobody was injured. We heard the men yelling at the back, and the horses came through the gorge at a great rush….one native, who had been very determined the day before and was very active on this occasion, stood on the edge of the cliff throwing spear after spear. He must have been struck by one of the rifle bullets, as he disappeared soon afterwards. We adjusted the packs and made north, thinking that the natives would follow us into the forest country, as they had done the year before; but they thought discretion the better part of valour, and we saw them no more'.",-12.241,132.862,1875-06-01,1875-06-03,"<i>NTTG</i>, August 7, 1875, p 2 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3144339"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3144339</a>; Lewis, 1922, pp 141-144; Daly, 1887, pp 226-227.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=994,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:54,994,Kunwinjku,SA,NT,Darwin,1875 June-July,Afternoon,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,20,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Overlander(s),Horse,Unknown,Firearm(s),***,0,,,,,,57,29,3,Daly and Mary River,Early,Daly and Mary River: Early,North,North

257,td0e05,1336,"Convincing Ground, Portland Bay",Site,"Some time between March 1833 and March 1834, north of Allestree, a group of whalers massacred Kilcarer gundidj people (Dhanwurd wurrung speakers) over claims to a beached whale. A journal entry of Edward Henty indicates that by 27 September 1835 this location had come to be known as 'Convincing Ground' (Peel, 2013).
<br>
Chief Protector GA Robinson first heard of the massacre in 1841 from settler Edward Henty during his first visit to Portland, along with two accounts of how the place got its name from Police Magistrate Blair and surveyor Tyers: 'He [Henty] said that some time ago, I suppose two or three years, a whale broke from her moorings and went on shore. And the boats went into get it off, when they were attack [sic] by the natives who drove them off. He said the men [whalers] were so enraged that they went to the head station for their firearms and then returned to the whale, when the natives again attack them. And the whalers then let fly, to use his expression, right and left upon the natives. He said the natives did not go away but got behind trees and threw spears and stones. They, however, did not much molest them after that. There is a spot on the north shore, where the big works are I think, which is called the ""Convincing Ground"" and I was informed that it got its name from some transactions with the natives of the kind just mentioned. So Mr Blair said. Mr Tyers however said it was because when the whites had any disputes they went on shore and there settled if by fighting. I however thing the former most feasibly, especially after what Mr Henty himself stated' (GA Robinson Journal 16 May 1841, in Clark 1998b, p 211).
<br>
The following day Robinson visited the Convincing Ground site and recorded the following observations: 'Now, the cause of this fight, if such an unequal contest can be so designated, firearms [are] certain death against spears, was occasioned by the whalers going to get the whalebone from the fish . . . which the natives considered theirs and which it had been so for 1000 of years previous, they of course resisted the aggression on the part of the white men. It was the first year of the fishery, and the whalers having used their guns beat them off and hence called the spot the Convincing Ground. That was because they [the whalers] convinced them [the natives] of their mistake and which, but for their firearms, they perhaps could not have done' (GA Robinson Journal 17 May 1841, in Clark 1998b, p 214).
<br>
Ten months later, on 23 March 1842, Robinson met 30 Aboriginal people from at least five clans in the region at Captain Alexander Campbell's station at Merri River near Port Fairy. Clark comments: 'Presumably these people informed him of the Convincing Ground massacre, for Robinson noted in his journal for that day that it was eight or nine years earlier that the collisions between the whalers and the Aborigines took place...The two survivors in 1841 were Pollikeunnuc and Yarereryarerer' (Clark 1995, p 19). In the official report to Superintendent La Trobe of his 1841 journey into Western Victoria, Robinson mentioned the massacre: 'Among the remarkable places on the coast, is the ""Convincing Ground"", originating in a severe conflict which took place a few years previous between the Aborigines and Whalers on which occasion a large number of the former were slain. The circumstances are that a whale had come on shore and the Natives who feed on the carcass claimed it was their own. The whalers said they would ""convince them"" and had recourse to firearms. On this spot a fishery is now established' (Robinson in Clark 1995, p 19).
<br>
In 2005, Michael Connor contested Clark's account of the massacre and the origins of the name 'Convincing Ground' (Connor 2005, pp140-155). He made three key claims: that Robinson first heard of the story of the massacre as 'an after-dinner story of violence which he then embroidered on' (Connor 2005, p140); that Robinson relied on second hand accounts and never interviewed any witnesses to the massacre; and that (following a comment by Major Mitchell) Aboriginal people cooperated with whalers rather than fought with them (Connor 2005 pp140-142) [note: a previous statement here that Connor claimed 'the name ""Convincing Ground"" was coined by Major Mitchell' has been removed].
<br>
Clark responded to the claims in 2011. He pointed out that Robinson was an experienced massacre investigator and cited as an example his extensive investigation of massacres in Tasmania (Clark 2011, p 85). Following Edward Henty's account of the Convincing Ground massacre, Robinson visited the site the next day and over the following months, sought further evidence from Aboriginal people and settlers, and then summarised his findings in the report to Superintendent La Trobe in 1842. Finally, Clark pointed out that the name 'Convincing Ground' was first used by Edward Henty in his diary in 1835, at least a year before Mitchell arrived at Portland Bay (Clark 2011, p 94). Clark concluded that the massacre probably took place in the whaling season between March 1833 and March 1834, that is, at least seven months before the Henty brothers arrived at Portland Bay (Clark 2011, pp 101-102).
<br>
In Major Mitchell's description of interactions between Aboriginal people and whalers they do not appear to be in amicable cooperation, but instead Aboriginal people avoided contact with whalers and sought only to manipulate them into beaching whales for their benefit: 'The natives never approach these whalers, nor had they ever shown themselves to the white people of Portland Bay but, as they have taken to eat the castaway whales, it is their custom to send up a column of smoke when a whale appears in the bay, and the fishers understand the signal. This affords an instance of the sagacity of the natives for they must have reflected that, by thus giving timely notice, a greater number will become competitors for the whale and that consequently there will be a better chance of the whale running ashore, in which case a share must fall finally to them' (Mitchell, 1839).
<br>
Clark summarised three stories of the origin of the place name, 'Convincing Ground': 'Blair's account that it related to a particular massacre; Tyers's account that it originated from the settlement of disputes between whalers; and JG Wiltshire's version connected with the explorer, Mitchell,' adding that, 'As we have seen, Wiltshire's version has been invalidated' (Clark, 1995 p 20).
<br>
Connor argues in favour of Tyers's account (Connor, 2005 p 140-156) showing that 'convincing ground' was a term for a place where 'prize or grudge fights are held' (Connor, 2005, p 142). He imagines an elaborate scenario of whalers rowing 6km back and forth to fight over a beached whale which they had little interest in. However, it is equally unreasonable to think that whalers would travel 6 kilometres from their anchorage to conduct a fight when they could easily fight where they were, where their boats were anchored. An 1845 map based on an 1840 survey made by Tyers and Masters in 1840 shows 4 huts in the location of Convincing Ground, though they are not labelled. They are probably very recent constructions as the whale fishery at Convincing Ground was not established until 1841 (Tyers & Masters, 1845). Whale boats were small, fast vessels equipped with both oars and sails. The whalers would have sailed, not rowed, and at 5 knots they could have gone to the head station at Portland and returned to Convincing Ground within two hours.
<br>
Mitchell's description shows that the heads of beached whales were economically valuable. An 1843 news article from Portland Bay shows that whalers were quick to seize any opportunity to capture whales that strayed too close to shore: 'Mr. Robertson, in charge of the Messrs. Henty's station at the Convincing ground, observed a whale, of the Hunchback species, which had, got inside a reef near the junction of the first river and was unable to extricate itself. Mr. Robertson, although there was no other person present, immediately dashed through the surf, up to the neck, and by means of a harpoon succeeded in despatching the monster' (The Colonial Observer, 4 March 1843, p 858).
<br>
This was not simply a beached whale or a 'castaway', but one which the whalers had done the hard and dangerous work of catching, for it had broken its mooring. It is reasonable to think that if driven off by Aboriginal people, and given the relationships between them were tense, that whalers would not give up the catch easily, even if only the head or bones were viable once on the beach.
<br>
For whalers a 'convincing ground' would be any location that a fight is carried out so it is less likely that the location was not so called as the designated location for all whalers to meet and fight. It is more likely that whalers applied it euphemistically to name this specific location where a fight occurred between whalers and Aboriginal people. Connor presents no evidence that whalers used this location for fights, and, among the earliest sources only provides Tyers' speculation on the reason for the name, while there is an earlier account from one of the first colonists in the region, Henty, that there was a conflict between Aboriginal people and whalers and both Robinson and Blair found it most credible that Convincing Ground was named for such a conflict. Although Henty, as recorded by Robinson, didn't use the place name in describing the conflict, Henty did use the place name in his journals.
<br>
Importantly, Connor ultimately doesn't conclude there was no fight between Aboriginal people and whalers as described in Henty's story. Connor's conclusions are only that the fight did not take place at Convincing Ground but was more likely at Double Corner, much closer to the Portland whaling settlement; that Convincing Ground was not named after the incident described by Henty (Connor, 2005, pp153 – 154), and that the story of a massacre at Convincing Ground has been embellished and exaggerated in subsequent accounts (Connor, 2005, pp 150-153).

While there has been much speculation around the origins of the name Convincing Ground, there seems no reason to doubt the earliest account given by Henty, recorded by Robinson, that it was named for this massacre.",-38.275,141.662,1833-03-01,1834-03-31,"Peel, 2013; Clark 1995, p 19; Connor 2005, 2010; Clark 2008b; Clark 2008c; Clark 2011; Mitchell, 1839 <a href=""https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00036.html"">https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00036.html</a>; The Colonial Observer, 4 March 1843, p 858 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/226361697/22363117"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/226361697/22363117</a>; Tyers, 1845 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-233815684"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-233815684</a>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=503,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:53,503,Dhauwurd wurrung,PPD,VIC,Portland,1834,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,20,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Whaler/Sealer(s),Foot,Reprisal,Firearm(s),**,,,,,,,1,1,1,Eumeralla,Sealing and Whaling,Eumeralla: Sealing and Whaling,South East,Early
329,td0e0f,1336,Murdering Flat,Site,"Sources are contradictory and confused about what happened on the Henty's Merino Downs run in 1838, but available information and context suggest it is more likely than not that a massacre known as 'Murdering Flat' occurred in response to the murder of a shepherd on the Henty's property.
<br>
The Henty family moved to the Portland Bay area after struggling to establish themselves at Swan River and King George Sound, and then in Van Diemen's Land. At Portland Bay in 1834 they were among the first Europeans (Labilliere, 1878) and in 1837 took up a large run further inland at Merino Downs (<i>Hamilton Spectator</i>, 29 November 1884 p2). Perhaps aware of the concerns of the reformist government in England when James Henty wrote to Governor Arthur in 1834 he included a memorial from Thomas Henty to Chief Secretary of State for the Colonies, which said, 'Four of his sons having had considerable experience in the management and treatment of the Natives at Swan River and King George's Sound; at which latter place they are better managed and under better control than in most others. A son of your Memorialist was living within three miles of the settlement at King George's Sound between one and five years, in the midst of whole tribes of aborigines totally unprotected and such was the good feeling kept up between them, that no instance of misconduct occurred among them; they were taught to labour for, and earn the food with which they were occasionally supplied' (Labilliere, 1878, ch1).
According to Francis (Frank) Henty, when they first moved to Merino Downs they established friendly relations with Aboriginal people: 'On first settling at Merino Downs you will naturally suppose that conflict would take place with the natives, but, fortunately for myself, I had personally less trouble than anyone. After the first few weeks they became friendly, and began to assemble at intervals, increasing their number until they reached several hundreds, having, apparently, collected all their, tribes around from the greatest distance they could manage, but how far a distance I was not likely to know' (<i>Hamilton Spectator</i>, 29 November 1884 p2).
Relations soon deteriorated: 'When out stations were formed they soon became familiar with the ways and loneliness of the shepherds, commenced thieving, and attacked the hut, where one shepherd, whose name was Heath, was cruelly murdered. Shortly afterwards another man was attacked in his hut near Merino. He, however, was prepared, and when the native entered the hut and laid hold of the gun with his left hand in the act of striking with the ""lee angle"" in the other, he got the contents of the gun through his chest...' (<i>Hamilton Spectator</i>, 29 November 1884 p2).
Frank Henty's statement that 'I am thankful to be able to say, gentlemen, that I was so fortunate as never to cause blood shed or injury to the natives in my life' (<i>Hamilton Spectator</i>, 29 November 1884 p2) implies that colonists in the area at the time were typically involved in killing or injuring Aboriginal people, and it was unusual that he had not personally killed or injured anyone.
<br>
In February 1839 Dr D.C. Collier wrote two letters to the Colonial Secretary about his experiences in Portland Bay suggesting a police force be sent there to catch runaway convicts and to protect Aboriginal people from whalers and the 'immense quantity of spiritous liquors being sold by Messrs Henty, the result of which is extremely calamitous. Hostilities commence and the pass word is ""One must take the law in our own hands as the Government will give us no protection""' (HRV v.IIb, p628). In the second he reported, '...the late most awful and atrocious massacre committed upon the aboriginal native at Australia Felix by sheep and cattle herdsmen in the employ of Messrs Henty who have established themselves as whalers at Portland Bay and carrying on sheep grazing at Australia Felix... Owing to the many base acts committed by these stockmen towards the wives and daughters of these unhappy people... [Aboriginal people] murdered a hut-keeper who was guilty of the above mentioned infamy and also during his stay having shot a great number without motive, without reason, and without any cause, but that of being unable to take away their females... Upon the report of the murder of the hut-keeper being made to a Mr Edward Henty, he proceeds to Australia Felix, taking with him two armed men and all the powder and balls that could be found at their stores at the Bay. Upon their arrival Mr Henty issued his edict, armed, equipped, and ammunitioned to I believe the number of 14 men. They proceeded to take, as stated by them, their revenge and fell in the evening with a hut full. Upon their hearing the noise of some footsteps the Aborigines came out and an alarm was given the whole, and as they came out they were shot, and those stockmen that had no firearms were found with a pole at the end of which a one-half of a sheep shears was placed, and some of the unfortunate mothers, with infants in their arms, crying for mercy, were perforated through' (HRV v.IIb, p629).
<br>
In response to his letter Governor Gipps sent Captain Fyans with Mounted Police and a surveyor to investigate the allegation. Fyans and his group had a difficult journey and were watched and escaped spearing by Aboriginal people on the way to Portland (Fyans, 1986, p 225). In a letter to Colonial Secretary Thomson from Portland Fyans wrote, '... towards Port Fairy, the natives are numerous, and to all appearance in great agitation at our appearance, which to me fully proves of bad acts being committed on them' (Fyans, 1986, p 228).
<br>
In describing his investigation in his memoirs, Fyans wrote, 'The only Europeans in the country, Mr Henty and Mr Winter, these gentlemen had a difference regarding boundary lines, though not a living soul was to oppose their voracious wishes in taking and holding whatever they wished.' After two days at Merino Downs he added, 'Spending two days on this part of our mission, we left our friends, wishing them prosperity. Here again I was indebted to Mr Henty, who kindly provided us, restoring our commissariat' (p 229).
<br>
Collier's reputation was discredited by residents at Portland and by Fyans: 'Asking for the character and description of the Doctor, receiving the very worst possible, on the oath of many, I suspected that he was a downright imposter' (Fyans, 1986, p 229). Governor Gipps had also been suspicious of Collier's identity (HRV, vIIb, p 631).
<br>
While favouring the Henty's reputation over Collier's, who had gone to Van Diemen's Land at the time, and was not interviewed, Fyans does not state whether the massacre did or did not occur or whether the Hentys or their employees were involved.
<br>
Edward Henty made a sworn deposition on 11 June 1839 writing that, 'From my first arrival in 1834 to October 1838, we were on most friendly terms with the natives, with the exception of a disturbance in June 1838 at one of our out-stations. One native was shot by Joseph Bonsor, after receiving a severe blow with a waddy on the right temple... About the middle of October, my brother Mr John Henty sent in from the station, about 55 miles from this, stating that William Heath, shepherd, had been barbarously murdered by seven natives. I proceeded out with two men, armed.' At the scene they found the deceased shepherd. 'On the following day I proceeded with a party of five. We were armed. About 10 miles we came up with a number of women and four men... They informed us that the natives who committed the murder were about six miles ahead of us. We went on but did not find them. We returned home, since which time, I believe, it has never given any of my family the slightest consideration, and at the present time we are on the best of terms with the different tribes in this place.' Edward Henty further said his employees were free men from Van Diemen's Land, and that spirits were not provided to them and that he had little trouble with them (HRV vIIB, pp 631-632).
<br>
Trevor and Samuel Winter, on the Henty's neighbouring run, said in their sworn depositions that Charles Corrigan had shot a 15 or 16 year old Aboriginal boy in November. In October one of the Winter's men had been speared and '... a disturbance had taken place with the natives... The natives informed Mr Henty's people that two of their tribe had been killed. I made inquiry into the affair and could come to no conclusion... The reason of the natives calling at my place and the disturbance originated in a quarrel with Mr Henty's men. I have never heard of my natives being burnt, or that any considerable number have been killed' (HRV vIIb, p 635). He added that in other incidents overlanders led by Captain Hart had armed themselves to drive Aboriginal people out of the river and that William Jefry had been speared (HRV vIIb, p 635). The spearing of Jefry occurred in October during a stock raid involving 300 to 400 Aboriginal people: 'During my master's absence in October, from 300 to 400 natives came on the sheep... I went on the hill with Elliott and Corrigan to keep the natives off. They flung spears at us. I was speared through the shoulder and back' (HRV vIIb, p 637).
<br>
Based on the reputation of Collier, and these reports, Cannon says that 'Unless perjury on a grand scale took place, it appears that Dr Collier's allegations were grossly exaggerated versions of other incidents' (HRV vIIb, p 627). While Collier uses sensationalised language, it is reasonable to think that 'perjury on a grand scale' would occur in these circumstances. The region was almost exclusively populated by whalers who were notorious for abducting women and whalers were involved in the Convincing Ground massacre in 1833; by former convicts and runaway convicts who had a culture of not informing to police, and; by squatters in open defiance of the government who were desperate to succeed. Many of these people had come from Van Diemen's Land immediately following the 'Black War' and conflict had already broken out to the east on the overland from Sydney to Melbourne. Colonists in this area were typically complicit in violence against Aboriginal people. The Myall Creek massacres and executions had recently taken place so colonists expected to hang if they confessed to massacring Aboriginal people. The one killing of an Aboriginal person that Edward Henty admitted to was committed by Joseph Bonsor, who had already died in an unrelated accident (HRV vIIb, p 632). In this situation, an isolated complicit outlaw community stonewalling and dodging a visiting police investigator is to be expected and it would be strange if perjury on a grand scale did not occur (HRV vIIb p 632). Fyans wrote, '...in fact every fellow appears the master, and no doubt numerous bad and improper acts have been committed and hid from us. I have spoken to many of the men about here, almost without receiving a civil reply' (HRV vI, p253).
<br>
Most people in Australia at that time had dubious backgrounds, particularly in the unsanctioned frontier settlement at Portland, so it is highly unlikely a massacre could be reported by anyone other than someone with a dubious reputation. Collier was not interviewed and had no opportunity to defend his reputation or allegations. Whatever his background, in this social milieu, Dr Collier would not have made accusations lightly for fear of reprisal, and it is not surprising that he fled to Van Diemen's Land.
<br>
Fyans's account must also be read with caution. After a long and arduous journey, Fyans was treated with great hospitality by the wealthy Henty family and his party's supplies generously replenished, ""There was nothing to be procured in the place, this worthy gentleman [Mr Henty] affording us every needful requisite' (Fyans, 1986, p 227). Fyans and the Henty family went on to become successful and respected members of colonial society. The Henty family was particularly wealthy and powerful by the time Fyans wrote his memoirs. On a separate occasion Fyans praised colonists, who had killed four Aboriginal people during a sheep raid at the Leigh River: 'I saw some four natives that had been shot dead. I investigated the affray, and gave much credit to the men for their good conduct' (Bride, 1898, p 115).
<br>
Fyans read Henty's journals and did not find any evidence in them that the Hentys were involved in a massacre: 'I have taken some depositions here and I have also read over carefully Mr Henty's Journal of all acts committed since 1934 to the present time' (p 255 HRV Ia). Edward Henty's journal notes nothing suggesting the massacre in October 1838 (Peel, 2013). At first glance it appears that in October 1838 Edward Henty might have been occupied with farm business every day except Sundays. However, Edward Henty later stated in his deposition in 1838 that he and a group of armed men had ridden out after William Heath had been killed. The journal makes no reference to the killing of William Heath. Edward Henty's deposition also mentions that Joseph Bonsor had shot an Aboriginal person in June 1838, and later shot himself by accident but the only mention of Bonsor in Edward's journal of 1838 is a list of supplies he was equipped with and that he took down a cooperage. Winter's deposition mentions killings related to Captain Hart's overlanding expedition to Adelaide but again, the only mention of Captain Hart in the journal relates to his arrival, departure and inventories. That Fyans read the Henty's journals and found nothing to incriminate them tells us nothing as the journals are concerned with routine farm business and arrivals and departures, and exclude noteworthy and violent incidents, even the deaths of their own shepherds that they detail elsewhere.
Although favouring Henty, Bassett acknowledges that although many of Fyans's reports of his expedition remain, Fyans's full report, which was to be made when he returned to Geelong, 'has not been found' (Bassett p 447). Bassett also suggests that 'the fact that official appointments were given not long after to both Edward and Stephen Henty is conclusive proof that Governor Gipps - no friend to squatters - was fully satisfied that Collier's sensational charges, so far as the Hentys were concerned, were false' (Bassett, p 447). Aside from the Myall Creek massacre no colonist was ever convicted of a massacre. Another possibility is that Gipps was artfully navigating the conflicting demands of the British Government in London and the realities of the frontier, including the threats of powerful squatters and the wealth they generated. The phrase 'so far as the Hentys were concerned' allows for a massacre having occurred on their property or by their staff, without their direct involvement in the killing.
<br>
That at least one of the Henty family was in favour of exterminating Aboriginal people in the region is revealed in Robinson's journals, several years after the event. In his journal entry of 20 May 1841 Robinson wrote that he encountered Mr Henty and Police Magistrate Blair, some time after the murder of Morton and that, 'They were under great excitement - thought the natives of this tribe should be exterminated... He, Blair, said he knew what he would do if he was governor. He would send down soldiers and if they did not deliver up the murderer he would shoot the whole tribe. I said it would not perhaps be so easy. Mr Henty said there would be no difficulty on the Glenelg as they had only the river to fly too [sic] and they could soon ferrit [sic] them out from among the rocks' (Clark, 1998b, p 222). That Henty not only agreed but had practical advice on how extermination could be carried out suggests that one of the Hentys could have been involved, or at least condoned, the earlier massacre at Murdering Flat.
<br>
A writer calling themself 'Vagabond', in a brief history of the region in 1885, wrote that, 'The handful of settlers then had to take the law into their own hands, and exacted summary retribution, which served as a warning for the future. ""The Fighting Waterholes"" was the name first given to the battle scene, but to the present generation it is known as ""Murdering Flat."" The blacks have all gone now...' (The Argus, 25 April 1885, p 4)
<br>
'Vagabond' conflated Murdering Flat with another massacre, Fighting Waterholes. This contributes to confusion in later accounts, though at the time, it was corrected by Francis Henty: 'The conflict alluded to, of which I necessarily heard soon after its occurrence, was, as ""The Vagabond"" rightly says, at the ""Fighting Waterholes;"" but these are at least eight or ten miles from the junction of Bryant's Creek with the Wannon, being situated to the north or north west of the Koonongwootoong station, taken up by and at that time in the occupation of the Messrs. White Brothers' and adds that 'The plain mentioned derived its name of the ""Murdering Flat"" from the fact that one of the first shepherds I had with me was cruelly murdered there, doubtless by the natives, though his death was not avenged in the manner described; neither am I aware that any conflict ever took place on the flat, which lies on the south side of the Wannon, at its junction with Bryant's Creek. I would reiterate what I have already stated in public - that I never fired a shot at, or injured an aboriginal, in my life' (The Argus, 16 May 1885).
<br>
Francis is again specific in stating only that he himself had never killed anyone. Aside from the Convincing Ground massacre 5 years earlier, the massacre at Murdering Flat would be the first inland massacre in a period of fighting commonly known as the 'Eumeralla Wars', one of the most intense concentrations of massacres in Australia. The events at Murdering Flat were followed by a dramatic escalation in violence, including the attack of a war party of hundreds of Aboriginal warriors at the Winters' property. There were five massacres in the immediate vicinity of Merino Downs in 1840, including 'Fighting Waterholes'.
<br>
Statements suggesting that the Hentys were uniquely on peaceful terms with Aboriginal people are contradicted, sometimes in their own words. In 1842 Fyans listed 19 pastoralists who had lost stock in raids, among them the Hentys. As well as the killing of their shepherd, S.G. Henty recalled, contradicting his brother Edward, that there was hostile resistance from their first arrival at Merino Downs to the extent they had difficulty retaining staff: '1837. It was not until the 3rd of August in this year that we succeeded in driving our first flock on to the Merino Downs Station a day that will be memorable in the recollection of the family of the writer as the natal day of his first-born son, Richmond. The remainder of our stock was sent up as fast as possible, with which we occupied the stations known as Muntham, Connell's run, and Sandford. At this time we had very great difficulty in retaining the services of any men, owing to the hostile disposition of the natives, to which many of our men's lives were sacrificed' (Bride, 1898, p263). While Francis Henty may not have been involved in the violence it is unreasonable to think that Aboriginal people singled out the Henty property for diplomatic immunity or that, having failed elsewhere and with no other recourse, that, under duress, the Hentys or their employees took no action to preserve their run, particularly when shepherds and flocks were attacked or killed.
<br>
In 1964 or 1965 local historian, E.R. Trangmar published a short talk he says was based on 10 books, 5 diaries and interviews with local residents descended from pioneers. Unfortunately, he didn't indicate which source he obtained specific details from. In it he distinguishes 5 massacres in the immediate area and provides clarifying information to avoid confusion between two incidents referred to as 'Murdering Flat' (Trangmar, 1964, p 5). According to Trangmar, 'Murdering Flat' was previously 'Clover Flat' and a cannon was used in the massacre (this is the 'Murdering Flat' discussed here). He doesn't name Henty or give a date. The other 'Murdering Flat' was a poisoning between Sandford Bridge at the junction of the Glenelg and Wannon Rivers. This second 'Murdering Flat' is about 10km west of Clover Flat (see Connell's Ford). These are both distinct from 'Fighting Waterholes', comprised of two massacres (see 'Fighting Hills' and 'Fighting Waterholes'), which 'Vagabond' had conflated with 'Murdering Flat'. Another was a poisoning at Wootong Vale. In Trangmar's account of Murdering Flat he wrote, 'While the blacks were holding a corroboree and feasting on some freshly killed stock they were fired upon by the settlers, using an old cannon loaded with bolts, nails, gravel and stones with telling effec.' (Trangmar, 1964, p 5)
<br>
Although Trangmar carefully distinguishes these massacres, it's not clear if the claim a cannon was used results from confusion. Colliers said that Edward Henty brought 'two armed men and all the powder and balls that could be found at their stores at the Bay' (HRV vIIb, p629) and it seems strange he would not have mentioned a cannon. However, it is possible a small, portable, cannon was readily available as Edward Henty was involved with whaling and many ships of the time were equipped with small cannon or 'swivel guns'. Edward Henty admitted that when he heard of the murder of two shepherds, he 'proceeded out with two men, armed' (HRV vIIB, pp 631-632). Historian Critchett wrote that the Hentys' neighbours, the Winters and the Wedges, both had swivel guns at their properties (Critchett, 1992). The Wedges took up a run at land previously occupied by the Hentys (Bride, 1898, p 162). It is reasonable to think the Hentys as whalers and farmers, had a swivel gun at their property, just as their neighbours did. Like Edward Henty, Chas Wedge wrote that 'Up to this time [1839] we had but little trouble with the aborigines' and added that, 'but they now began to attack our shepherds, whom they drove from their flocks'. He also mentions the overlanding to Adelaide such as the expedition mentioned in Winter's deposition during Fyan's investigation in 1839 (Bride, 1898, p 162). This suggests that amidst the escalating violence of late 1838 and 1839 a major event, beyond 'payback' killing of individuals, most likely the Murdering Flat massacre, triggered a large-scale resistance, involving war parties of hundreds of warriors raiding and killing colonists and thousands of livestock and the numerous massacres of the Eumeralla Wars.",-37.621,141.582,1838-10-15,1838-10-20,"Fyans, 1986; Labilliere, 1878

97,td0c79,1336,Mt Emu Creek,Site,"This massacre was organised in retaliation for the killing of some sheep by two Aborigines on what is now Glenormiston station, near Lake Terang, managed by Frederick Taylor. Ian D. Clark has written about this incident at great length: 'Having heard of the encampment' of between 45 and 52 Aboriginal men, women and children from three different clans in the gully on Mt Emu Creek, Frederick 'Taylor and two associates, James Hamilton and Broomfield, headed a party of shepherds with the intention of attacking them... As they approached the gully on horseback, the party formed an extended line with Taylor in the centre. They found the Aboriginal people asleep [suggesting that this was a dawn raid] and advanced shouting and immediately fired upon them, killing the whole group except 12 people. They afterwards threw the bodies in a neighbouring waterhole. One of the survivors was Woreguimoni, a Gulidjan, who had hidden in the long grass.' Another survivor, Karn (also known as 'Mr Anderson'), 'returned after [the killers] had left the scene and began to remove the bodies from the waterhole, placing them on the ground four deep, head by head. In the course of this, he was discovered by some of the Europeans, who took him and his wife and child... to Taylor's home station, where he and his family were given provisions so that they would stay nearby, and away from the waterhole.' They then sent a cart to the waterhole 'and the bodies [were] brought up to the home station, where they were conveyed to some other waterholes and thrown in... Two further survivors of the massacre, Bareetch Cuurneen - alias Queen Fanny, the ""chiefess"" of the clan - and a child, were pursued to Wuurna Weewheetch... a point of land on the west side of Lake Bullen Merri. With the child on her back she swam across to a spot called Karm karm, below present day Wuurong homestead, and escaped.' (Clark ID 1995, pp 105-118)
<br>
According to Clark, in another account of this massacre, another survivor, Wangegamon, a Djargurd wurrung man, saw his wife and child killed. 'After the bodies were thrown in the creek, the water was stained with blood. Grieving, he remained near the gully for two days... two days after the massacre two men named Anderson and Watson... asked Taylor why he had killed so many women and children. Anderson [Karn], Charles Courtney, James Ranslie and James Hamilton subsequently made some fires and burned the bodies. Two days after the cremation, Taylor, Watson and Karn returned with a sack and removed all the bones that had not been consumed by the fires' (Clark, 1995, pp 107-108). 
<br>
Taylor disappeared after this incident and apparently went to India but later returned to manage a station in Gippsland. He was replaced by a man named Symonds who took Assistant Protector Charles Sievwright to the scene of the crime in January 1840. Sievwright also interviewed one of the Aboriginal survivors, Tainneague, and decided that between 20 and 30 Aboriginal people had been killed in this incident while Edward Williamson, overseer at the Buntingdale mission, believed that the number was 35. GA Robinson was convinced that an entire tribe had been eradicated. Squatter Niel Black bought this run in late 1840 because it was already ""cleared out"" (see Kiddle, 1961, p 122).  Some of the Aboriginal survivors sought sanctuary at the Wesleyan Mission at Buntingdale and it is largely through the efforts of missionaries like the Reverend Benjamin Hurst and Francis Tuckfield, as well as Assistant Protector Charles Sievwright and Chief Protector GA Robinson, that so much is known about this massacre. The next owner of Glenormiston station, Niel Black, mentioned the massacre in a letter to TS Gladstone, September 9, 1840. Mary Shaw wrote about the massacre in her book 'Mt Emu Creek' (Shaw, 1969, p 27; Clark, 1995, pp 105-118).",-38.057,143.027,1839-10-01,1839-10-31,"Kiddle 1961, p 122;  Shaw 1969, p 27; Clark ID 1995, pp 105-118.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=514,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,514,Djargurd Wurrung or Keeray- Woorroong or Wirngilgnad dhalinanong,PPD,VIC,Geelong,1839,Dawn,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,35,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,"Settler(s), Stockmen/Drover(s)",Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),***,,,,,,,2,2,0,Eumeralla,South East,Eumeralla: South East,South East,South
105,td6286,1336,Wootong Vale,Site,"In a published talk presented in 1964 or 1965 historian E.R. Trangmar distinguished 5 massacres in Western Victoria. One of them is a brief mention of a poisoning with arsenic at Wooton Vale: 'Another case of murder occurred at Wootong Vale.

On 12 January 1841, the Reverend Joseph Orton made the following entry in his diary: 'The alleged cause of the attack was the aggressions of the natives. The attack of the Europeans was equally atrocious and unjustifiable, the result of which was that according to the depositions at least five natives were killed.

122,td0c7d,1336,Fighting Hills,Site,"According to Jan Critchett (1990, p 127) and Ian Clark (1995, p 145),  in February 1840, the five Whyte brothers occupied  Koonongwootong station on Koroit Creek, 6.5 kilometres north of present day Coleraine.  On 8 March they gathered a party of nine men armed with double-barrelled guns, comprising the five Whyte brothers on horseback and four convict shepherds on foot, including Daniel Turner, William Gillespie and Benjamin Turner, and 'hunted down' the Aborigines in the area, killing at least 40 of them on the grounds that some 'had made off with 127 sheep'. According to Clark (1995, p 145) 'The massacre took place at the Hummocks,…a unique rocky outcrop dissected by a narrow gorge of the Wando River and became known as Fighting Hills'. 
Assistant Protector Sievwright was 9.5 kilometres from the scene and quickly heard about the massacre from Aboriginal survivors who told him that 41 of their clan had been killed (Orton Papers, 12 January 1841). According to Clark, realising that the massacre could not be covered up, John Whyte, the youngest of the five brothers, decided to ride to Melbourne and make a personal report to Superintendent La Trobe (Clark, 1995, pp 145, 147). En route, on 23 March, he called in at Glenormiston Station near Terang and told squatter Niel Black his version of the events. According to Black, Whyte said that 25 Aborigines had been killed (Journal of Niel Black 1840 in Clark 1995, pp147-148).
In April 1840, 'the sole Aboriginal survivor of the massacre, Long Yarra or ""Lanky Bill"", was killed by George MacNamara, one of Francis Henty's hut keepers at Merino Downs' (Clark, 1995, p 146).
When Sievwright, arrived at the Whytes' station in May 1840 to take depositions from the attackers, according to missionary Joseph Orton, he was surprised to find that the Whyte brothers and their shepherds freely admitted what had happened and that there was little variation in their accounts of the slaughter, except in their estimates of the number killed – between 30 and 80 (Orton Papers 12 January 1841, ML A 1715).
In June 1841, the Reverend Joseph Orton  examined the depositions of the Whyte brothers and summarised the course of events. He said that the men  stayed up late the night before, preparing cartridges for their double-barrelled guns and ' [e]arly the next morning they followed the tracks of the sheep to some low hills covered with tea-tree about ten kilometres away. They tied up their horses, and crept slowly into the trees. Hearing Aboriginal voices, they crawled up to the edge of the clearing on the edge of the creek, where a meal of mutton was being prepared by a large group of [Bungandtji speakers].  As the white men moved to surround the camp, they were spotted. The women and children fled as the men rushed to grab their weapons. A spear was thrown and the men started firing. Daniel Turner was speared through the thigh, and one of the Whytes received an accidental gun-shot wound on the cheek, prompting the other gunmen to become ""savage to desperation""'. According to the Whyte brothers' statements, the [Bunganditji ]  tried valiantly to withstand the onslaught, one of them being shot nine times before he finally fell. Dozens more spears were thrown in what the Whyte brothers later described as lasting more than an hour, but none hit their targets' (Reverend Joseph Orton, 12 January 1841, ML A1715). 
In Melbourne, the Crown Prosecutor, James Croke, after examining the depositions of Daniel Turner, William Gillespie and Benjamin Wardle, considered that the Aborigines appeared to have been the aggressors in originally stealing the sheep and that William Whyte had killed two Aborigines only after a spear was thrown at him and John Whyte 'stated that no less than 200 spears were thrown and not less than 30 Aborigines were killed' (Whyte cited in Clark 1995, p. 149). Croke concluded that he could not accept the perpetrators' depositions on the grounds that they were self-incriminating and that in the absence of independent witnesses, he could not charge the men with anything (Croke cited in Clark 1995, p 149). 
In 1853,  squatter George Robertson, who moved into the area three days after the massacre, stated that 51 Aborigines were killed. 'They watched an opportunity, and cut off 50 sheep from Whyte Brothers' flocks, which were soon missed, and the natives followed; they had taken shelter in an open plain with a long clump of tea-tree, which the Whyte Brothers' party, seven in number, surrounded, and shot them all but one. Fifty one men were killed, and the bones of the men and sheep lay mingled together bleaching in the sun at the Fighting Hills.'

1,td0c7e,1336,Fighting Waterholes,Site,"As reported in Clark (1995, 152), after the massacre at Fighting Hills on 8 March 1840, the Aborigines returned to the Whyte Brothers' Konongwootong station a month later, and stole 'a number of sheep'. After unsuccessfully searching for a trail, 'to teach the Aborigines a lesson', the Whyte brothers and their stockmen separated…The Whytes rode to the nearest station to 'drown their disappointment' and the station hands, including Henry Skilton, William Fox, and two others, Henry and Bassett, 'returned to the home station. En route they passed the waterholes at which were camped some old men, women and children. They shot the entire camp' (Clark 1995, p 153).
<br>
William Moodie settled in the region in 1853, not long after the massacre, and wrote in his memoirs, 
'So far I have said very little about the blacks at Wando Vale. A few years before we went there they had received severe punishment and so had deserted that part of the country for a time. Reprisals were made after depredations committed at Konong Wootong and were carried out by a party organised by the Whyte brothers, first at the Fighting Waterholes and then by following the poor frightened creatures to the big ti-scrub in the Wando just below the station. A blackfellow told me about it years afterwards in his own way, ""Blackfellow all runem along a scrub in creek, lubra look up 
scrub, white fellow shoot her down. Two hundred fine fat lubra shot"". The number may not be reliable, as 
Jimmy when telling me, only held up his hands two or three times. Any way it was a rather inglorious victory for the Whyte brother's valiant army' (Moodie in Palmer, 1873, p 72).
<br>
According to local historian ER Trangmar, 'The place where Coleraine's water supply comes from used to be known as the ""Fighting Waterholes."" 
There a pitched battle was to have taken place between the angry mounted stockowners, the station hands, and 
the blacks. Naturally the weapons of the whites would take heavy toll, so the blacks quickly dispersed by slipping through the cordon of mounted men. When the whites reached their objective there was not a blackfellow there. 
The squatters rode to the nearest homestead and the men told to go 
home. The station hands came across camp of the old men, picanninies and 
women. They shot the lot. There was a great outcry at the time but no 
legal action was taken. The squatters sacked the men. 
After the massacre at the ""Fighting Waterholes"" the survivors asked to be 
allowed to leave the district of Konongwootong and Coleraine; the name 
of the tribe was Tarer-bur-er and their last chief was named Cart-ware-rer-coot. They went to ""Murndal"" and 
joined the Wanedeets on the Wannon 
river; They stayed there until they died out or went to the Condah Mission Station.'

124,td0c83,1336,Mustons Station,Site,"According to Ian Clark, 'In either April or May 1840, Mustons station near Mount Rouse, and leased by Peter Aylward and Augustine Barton', was alleged to have been 'attacked' by 300 Aboriginal people who took a number of Aylward's sheep to the other side of the Serra Range. 'In June, Aylward took his revenge in an act of reprisal in which seven Aborigines were killed and many others wounded' (Clark 1995, p. 66). RW Knowles, Robert Martin's overseer at Mount Sturgeon station, was a perpetrator in the massacre as was Robert Tulloh from nearby Bochara Station at the junction of the Wannon River and Grangeburn Creek.  On 27 June 1841, Tulloh told Chief Protector GA Robinson that he was one of eight horsemen in the party (Robinson cited in Clark 1998b, p. 284). The group not only included Aylward and Knowles, but also stockman George Robinson.
Historian Jan Critchett (1990) examined the depositions each of the men gave on different days on different properties to produce this account: '[They] came across a large party of Aborigines... Aylward estimated the Aborigines to number nearly 300, Knowles [or Knolles] more than 150, Tulloh about 500... The Europeans, on horseback, fired on them and then retreated... As soon as the three men had reloaded their guns, they charged again with the Aborigines fleeing before them. The ""engagement"" lasted a quarter of an hour' (p. 124). Aylward reported that 'there must have been a great many wounded, and several killed ... saw two or three dead bodies'. Knowles reported: 'Some of the Natives must have been wounded, but I saw none dead' (Aylward and Knowles cited in Critchett, 1990, pp. 124-5).",-37.876,142.337,1840-06-01,1840-06-30,"Clark ID 1995, p 66; Clark ID 1998b, pp 284, 305; Critchett 1990, pp 124-125.

2,td0c7f,1336,Mount Rouse,Site,"On 19 May 1840, overseer Patrick Codd was killed at Mount Rouse Station by five Aborigines of the Kolorer gundidj clan [Djab wurrung or Gai wurrung speakers], allegedly led by Taigara, also known as 'Roger the Russian', in retaliation for the murder of the Aboriginal warrior, Tuurap warneen. Taigara was later convicted and hanged for Codd's murder (Critchett, 1990, p 160) although Superintendent La Trobe was not convinced of his guilt on the grounds that there were no white witnesses at the murder (La Trobe to Gipps, 26 July 1842, cited in Shaw 1989, p 150).  Codd was overseer and bookkeeper for the Wedge Brothers at the Grange, Strathkellar, just above present day Hamilton. Five days before his death, Codd had 'gone across' to Mount Rouse station 'to superintend the stock there during the projected absence of the overseer, James M Brock' (Clark, 1995, p 62). Charles Wedge wrote to his father JH Wedge in England about what happened after the Aborigines had killed Codd: 'On the following day or soon after Codd met his death, the squatters in the neighbourhood went in pursuit of the natives; but, owing to the wetness of the season, they did not succeed in revenging themselves so far as they intended; however, I believe three or four suffered.... They [the squatters] are determined (as they pay for protection and receive none) to exterminate this hostile tribe, without such protection is given them as will enable them to live in comparative security' (Charles Wedge to JH Wedge, Enclosure in Russell to Gipps, 20 February 1841, HRA, I, xxi, p 242). On 29 April 1841, GA Robinson was told by Captain Campbell, storekeeper at Port Fairy, 'that in revenge for Codd's death, 20 had been taken' (Robinson's journal 29 April 1841, cited in Clark, 1998b, p 161).",-37.885,142.303,1840-06-11,1840-06-11,"Critchett, 1990, p 160; HRA, I, xxi, p 242; Clark 1995, pp 62-63,156; Clark 1998b, pp 160-162; Shaw, 1989, p 150.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=519,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,519,Djab wurrung or Gai wurrung,PPD,VIC,Geelong,11 June 1840,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,20,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Settler(s),Horse,Reprisal,"Firearm(s), Musket(s), Pistol(s)",***,Patrick Codd,,,,,,2,2,0,Eumeralla,South East,Eumeralla: South East,South East,South

A 'hunting party', comprising Charles and Henry Wedge, Joseph Read, Thomas Grant, William Marsh, John Cox and R.W. Knowles, recovered the sheep in the present day Victoria Valley and then killed 13 Aborigines (Orton Papers 12 January 1841, Orton Papers 1840-1842, ML A1715). When Assistant Protector Charles Sievwright took depositions from the killers and presented them to James Croke, the Crown Prosecutor, Croke 'formed the opinion that the Aborigines had perpetrated the ""outrages"" and ought to be punished. He considered the killings were in self-defence.' (Croke cited in Clark, 1995, p 157).

4,td0c88,1336,Connell's Ford,Site,"In November 1840, squatter Augustine Barton reported to Superintendent La Trobe that earlier that month, Thomas Connell, a hut keeper at the Henty Brothers' station at the junction of the Wannon and Glenelg Rivers, had fed damper laced with arsenic to 15 or 17 Bunganditj [Nundadjali or Wulluwwurrung] Aborigines, and that many of them had died. Barton said that the Aborigines had told him that 'Connell had divided the damper among the Aborigines who were visiting the station and that soon afterwards, the blacks were seized with violent pains in the stomach accompanied by retching' before they died (Enclosure in La Trobe to Robinson 27 November 1840, GA  Robinson Papers, Vol. 54). When news of the poisoning reached La Trobe in Melbourne, the Hentys sent Connell to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). On 3 June 1841, Chief Protector GA Robinson called in at nearby Tahara station and the lessee, George Winter, gave him the names of seven Aboriginal people said to have died from poison administered by one of Henty's employees (Robinson cited in Clark, 1998b, p 250).
In 1960, ER Trangmar, in his book, The Aborigines of Far Western Victoria, constructed a detailed account of the incident: 'A man named Connell, an outside overseer, was employed by the Henty brothers. He had a hut on the hill above the ford named after him. He got his rations delivered by dray once a month from the homestead. The blacks used to wait until he was out on the run and then rob his hut, particularly stealing his flour, which they learned how to use. Connell got very annoyed with the constant raiding so he mixed arsenic with half the flour and hid the other half. When he came home in the evening he found the poisoned flour had gone and blacks were dead by the dozen. They had mixed the flour on pieces of bark and partly cooked it in little cakes on the coals and had ravenously eaten it. A raging thirst was created, the natives went to the river to drink and tumbled head first into the stream, they were thus drowned as well as poisoned. It is stated that no graves were made, the bodies were put into the river. Connell hurriedly left the district and was never heard of again in these parts' (p 5).",-37.608,141.423,1840-11-01,1840-11-30,"G A Robinson Papers, Vol. 54 ML A7052; Trangmar, 1964, p 5; Clark, 1998b, pp 249-250.

Three Aboriginal men, three women and three children died from poisoning. Watton reported to Chief Protector GA Robinson, that 'it appears that the then overseer, Mr Robinson had sent away into the bush to some natives ... a quantity of what was supposed to be flour. Of this they partook, and were immediately seized with burning pains in the stomach, vomiting, sinking of the abdomen and intense thirst (which are the symptoms usually produced by arsenic); on the following morning three men, three women and three children were dead' (Watton cited in Clark, 1995, p 44). 'The bodies were burned, and Watton could not find any white witnesses. Despite the fact that Watton established that [overseer] Robinson had received a large quantity of arsenic just before the incident, there was not enough proof to convict Robinson or his associates' (Clark, 1995, p 44).

Captain Henry Dana and Native Police with Mr Edgar pursued them into the wetlands near Mt Eccles (formerly 'Mt Eeles') and killed eight to 10 Aboriginal people. From the descriptions of places and terrain provided it appears that Dana and the Native Police approached from the west, having been at '""Bassett's Station"" (also known as Crawford) near the head of
the Crawford River adjoining Hotspur' (Clark, p 46) and Edgar's station on the 'Fitzroy River run adjoining Heywood' (Clark, p 46) and pursued the group through stony and swampy country to where the sheep had been herded onto an island in the swamp, near Mt Eccles (Budj Bim). The Aboriginal people taunted them from scrub across the swamp, and made a counter attack on the sheep. Dana lead a counter attack and the massacre occured in the scrub across the from the island. These descriptions suggest that the massacre occurred in the scrub to the east of Lake Condah.

In a letter to La Trobe written at Mount Eckersly, September 6th 1843, H E Pultney Dana wrote that Christopher Basset, who lived 'on the head of the Crawford' had been killed by Aboriginal people. According to Dana, the Aboriginal people had also stolen his clothes and more than 200 sheep. 'I was out with my party accompanied by Mr Edgar of the Fitzroy in search of Mr Ward's child and had ascertained from a number of natives in the stones hear Mount Eels [Mt Eeles / Mt Eccles] that it had been murdered by a black named Harry who used to live with Messrs Whyte. I was proceeding along the edge of the large swamp when I came across the tracks of sheep. I followed them for a short distance and came on a number of natives driving and breaking the legs of a flock of sheep; he natives fled into the reeds in the swamp and thinking they would be safe challenged us.' Dana, the troopers and Mr Edgar dismounted and pursued the Aboriginal people into the swamp and in an affray, Mr Edgar shot one of them. They continued the pursuit through the swamp to a large island and found a great number of dead sheep and a coat. The aboriginal people reached the far side of the swamp, and the colonists paused to secure up to 40 unhurt sheep. The Aboriginal people returned and attempted to retake the sheep and taunted them from a tea tree scrub across the swamp. Dana wrote, 'I determined to cross the men over the swamp before daylight and if possible take some of the murderers and drive them out of the scrub. I accordingly did so and a little before sunrise attacked them in the scrub it was by far the worst place I have ever been in and it was a mercy that my small party was not cut off to a man. I did not succeed in taking any prisoners but before we could take the scrub and drive the natives eight or nine were shot... Spears, waddies and tomahawks were thrown at us from all directions but no person was struck except one of the men, Moonee Moonee who got a blow on his head from a large axe but did not appear to hurt him. If these murderers had escaped without punishment there is no knowing when this work would stop; the same tribe of Natives killed McKenzie and his man, Ward's child and now Basset, and the Country they fly to after committing these outrages is such that but few white men could follow them and I trust that your Honor will not consider that I have exceeded my duty for following them into their strong holds, and making them feel that they shall not murder and plunder with impunity.'

Gunditjmara people had long used this region as a base for the guerilla resistance and, according to Bonwick, when colonists were finally able to attack in this region around 1847 the people there were 'almost exterminated' (Bonwick, 1970 , p 170).

'The Stony Rises of Eeles could reveal many a tale of rapine and murder.
It was to these pathless solitudes that the Blacks were 
accustomed to drive sheep pillaged from the flocks of the early 
Settlers. Secure within such stony intricacies, they would break 
the legs of the animals to prevent them straying, and thus at their 
leisure indulge their love of mutton. Again and again was the trail 
followed by indignant shepherds; but the mighty barriers of basalt 
reared their crests, piles of boulders rose in all directions, caverns 
gaped before one, and the man who ventured into such a realm of 
wildness found no small difficulty to escape therefrom, while he 
was exposed in his stumbling career to the spear of his concealed 
enemy. 
Some ten years ago, however, the nest of robbers was gained, and 
the tribe almost exterminated under the following circumstances. 
A shepherd was murdered, his hut was rifled, and his fleecy charge 
was driven off by the Eeles mob. Vengeance was demanded. The 
arm of the law was too slow and weak to grasp the 
offenders. The neighbours assembled, armed, and set off in pursuit. 
Upon the return of the expedition, the coat and pocket book of the 
shepherd were exhibited. Resistance was said to have been offered, 
and shots were fired. Being interrogated as to the result of the 
conflict, as to what natives were killed, the only reply obtained was, 
that 'really there was such a smoke that they could see nothing.' 
Having, however, heard another tale upon this journey, being in 
company with one of the <i>visitors</i> of that region of stones upon that 
occasion, I venture to unfold the mystery, or, rather, to give 
another version. 
The party, who, though few in number, mustered in rifles and 
pistols about fifty shots, secured as guide to the <i>Stones</i> a half 
civilized native, and were <i>lucky</i> enough to fall upon a stray wild 
Blackfellow, who indicated the entrance into the fastnesses, and 
the route of the marauders. Camping for the night without fire 
within a mile or two of their unsuspecting victims, they resolved 
to make an onslaught upon them at the early dawn. Rough 
travelling delayed the march, and when they broke cover the 
poor creatures were taking their morning meal. Without a word of 
warning, the bullets of destruction were poured in among them. 
Some fell at the first discharge, others snatched up their children 
and tried to fly, and some warriors turned round in desperation 
and seized their spears to defend their families. But all resistance 
was in vain. The christians were too quick and too formidably 
armed for their heathen antagonists. Mothers, husbands, babes lay 
about the stones shrieking in maddening pain, moaning in dying 
struggle, or still in the sleep of death. More than thirty are said to 
have been thus laid low.' (Bonwick, 1970, pp 169-171)
<br>
Bonwick's informants also told him that during the massacre one of the Aboriginal guides tried to strike one of the colonists with a waddy but was himself shot, and that the other guide murdered a baby with a rock and finished off some of the dying with a weapon fashioned from a broken pair of shears (Bonwick, 1970, p 171).

140,td0cba,1336,"Murderers Flat, Darlot's Creek, Lake Condah Mission",Site,"The massacre at Murderers Flat near Lake Condah Mission is recorded in the oral history of Gunditjmara people (Hope, 2021).
Reconstructing from oral records, Clark believes the incident happened in the early 1850s at a site 'known to the Kerup gundidj (more commonly known as the Kerreupjmara) as Murderers Flat,' or Darlot's Creek, Lake Condah Mission (Clark, 1995, p 52). Aboriginal woman Rose Donker nee Lovett  (Donker, 1985, p 18, cited in Clark, 1995, p 52) has recounted what she knows of the massacre: '""My grandmother was Hannah MacDonald [later Lovett]. When she was small she walked with her brother Alfred and her mother from Macarthur to Condah Swamp. My grandmother was carried on her mother's back. They were looking for some place to live. They came to the Condah Swamp and there they found other Aboriginal people and families living there. There was a massacre there and they hid with their mother in the reeds until the fighting was over and then they headed off looking for somewhere safe. We were always told that Murderers Flat was where the fighting was. They were taken in and lived on the Condah Mission. I then understood they lived there as children, then as time went on they grew up there""' (Donker, 1985, p 18 cited in Clark, 1995, p 52).  According to Clark, 'In Jo Sharrock's reminiscences of Lake Condah (see Savill, 1976, cited in Clark, 1995, p 52), he refers to ""Harelip"" Johnny Dutton, who claimed to have been one of the few survivors of the ""Murdering Waterhole Massacre"" as a small boy. He hid in the water among the reeds' (Savill, 1976 cited in Clark, 1995, p 52). As both accounts refer to hiding in the reeds in the same area, they most likely are two accounts of the same incident (Clark, 1995, p 52).
<br>
The date of this massacre is difficult to estimate from oral history. Accepting that Hannah McDonald and her brother were children when they witnessed the massacre with their mother, Clark notes estimates of the date this occurred vary from 1842 to 1875 (Clark, 1995 p 52). Clark calculates dates between 1849 and 1854 based on Hannah McDonald's age of 91 at death in 1940 (Clark, 1995, p54). Connor, on the other hand, notes that she died in 1946 and estimates Hannah McDonald was born either in 1855 or, based on marriage certificates, in 1859 and her brother in 1860 (Connor, 2021). If she were 5 at the time of the massacre, and she was 91 when she died in 1946 (Portland Guardian Aug 22, 1946, p 4), the massacre would have occurred in 1860. No birth certificate for Hannah McDonald is available so her age is not certain. As this is a late date for a massacre in this region, 1860 or earlier is most likely.",-38.072,141.795,1850-01-01,1860-01-12,"Hope, 2021 <a href=""https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/a-moment-of-truth-how-hearing-our-first-nations-can-change-this-state-20210310-p579ky.html"">https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/a-moment-of-truth-how-hearing-our-first-nations-can-change-this-state-20210310-p579ky.html</a>; Clark ID, 1995, p 52; Connor, 2021; Portland Guardian Aug 22, 1946, p 4

<br>
Men at Mr Bowman's station were killed by Gomeroi people as punishment for abducting women. Henry Bingham reported that 'I am well informed those men armed themselves with Muskets and made a rush, on the camp of those Blacks in order to deprive them by force, of their women and in revenge for this they have fallen sacrifice to their own lawless conduct' (Bingham, cited in Milliss, 1992, p 153). The killing of these men prompted the massacre of a large number of Gomeroi people at Gravesend.
<br>
In 1837 Missionary L.E. Threlkeld wrote of a massacre preceding the killing of two more shepherds at <a href='detail.php?r=1116'>Anambah</a> which is probably the Gravesend massacre: 'two shepherds of Mr Cobb's station, Anambah,' on the Gwydir River, 'who were unfortunately murdered by the Blacks, suffered it is said, in consequence of the atrocities being committed against the Blacks by the stockmen in another part of the country, which drove them towards Mr Cobb's station, where they met the two shepherds and wreaked their vengeance, in retaliation, on the unhappy sufferers.: so I am informed by one who was there at the time of the catastrophe' (Threlkeld in Gunson 1974, vol.II, p.145). 
<br>
A chronology of killings of colonists records the date as November, 1837 (The Sydney Herald, 10 Dec 1838, p 2).
<br>
Milliss discusses the Gravesend massacre in his book Waterloo Creek:
'In evidence given in 1839 Mayne reported that a ""dreadful massacre"" was said to have been committed by stockmen in which as many as 200 Aboriginal people were killed. According to Milliss, Commissioner Edward Mayne 'gave no date for this massacre, except to say that it had taken place ""previous to the murder of the two shepherds at Mr Cobb's station"", which was itself, reputedly ""done in revenge for another outrage of a similar kind upon the blacks""' (Mayne cited in Milliss 1992, p.159).
<br>
Mayne's evidence to the Committee on Police and Gaols is as follows:
'I was encamped with various of the tribes in my District for about 
three months; there were at times 700 collected together, from a distance of one hundred 
miles. They were induced to come in and collect together from the messages I sent to 
them; there is at times great difficulty in inducing them to come in. I was anxious to have 
an opportunity of explaining to them the object of my coming among them; they seemed 
much pleased when I did so explain. 
Between the Rivers Namoi, Peel, and Gwyder (or Big River) there is a Black 
Native Population of between 2,000 and 3,000 persons. 
When I arrived in that part of my District, such was the want of confidence 
subsisting between the Whites and the Blacks, that wherever they encountered each other, 
the Whites expected themselves or cattle to be speared, and the Blacks expected to be 
fired at. 
It seemed to be the general impression among the Overseers and Stockmen in the 
Upper District, that the Namoi and Gwyder Blacks would unite and make a general attack 
on the Herds and Stations. I think it probable there were grounds for that impression. 
I consider that the desire of revenge on the part of the Blacks originated in various 
outrages committed on them by Stockmen and persons of that class. Previous to my 
arrival in the district, I believe many instances occurred in which the whites fired upon 
the Blacks when merely meeting them on the runs. I am informed that the whites have 
been known to rush them in the scrubs, and to fire upon their women and children; and that 
the Stockmen and Hutkeepers always went about with fire-arms. 
I issued a notice, cautioning the Stockmen from appearing with arms; it was 
obeyed, and acknowledged by themselves generally to be attended with the best effects. I caused it to be explained to the blacks, and it tended much to a more friendly and 
confidential feeling between both parties than had yet been exhibited. Previous to this, there were 
few of the runs that the blacks dared not show themselves upon without being either fired at, 
or hunted off like native dogs; nor were they permitted to approach the rivers without being 
subject to attack. I have scarcely ever seen joy more strongly depicted in any 
countenances, than in those of the blacks when I assured them that they might again fish quietly 
in the rivers without being driven away. I have found such accounts and information as 
I have received from time to time from the blacks to have proved substantially true. I would 
instance particularly the case of the murder of the blacks which took place near to Mr. 
Crawford's station, called Ardgowan Plains, situated on the Gwyder or Big River, and which 
was afterwards fully corroborated on oath by an approver. This murder took place about 
twelve days before Mr. Cobb's two shepherds were murdered by the blacks; about 1,000 
sheep were destroyed at the same time. The blacks informed me that this was done in revenge 
for the murder in question. They explained the delay to have arisen from the difficulty 
of getting all the tribes together sooner; there was, in fact, a much larger number of blacks 
assembled on that occasion than usual; the reports of some of the shepherds say 1,000. 
Great excitement prevailed at that time among the blacks. 
I believe two or three attacks had been made on them by the overseers and stock men within a few weeks on that part 
of the river. They stated, that finding it impossible to retaliate on the mounted stockmen, 
they determined to attack the shepherds and sheep. I conceive that the outrages committed upon the blacks were provoked in the first instance by their having speared cattle. 
The first outrage that I heard of occurred about two years ago. 
I consider that a good impression has been made upon the blacks by the late proceedings, and that a good opening has been made for the reception of a Protector amongst 
them. They complained in some instances of the white men interfering with their women, 
which appears to have been very common formerly; yet there is no doubt that they frequently 
lend them for a time; but even this is not done without a degree of jealousy, and more or 
less ill-feeling is likely to be engendered by it. There are some cases of black women 
living with white men who have families by them, some of whom it will perhaps be necessary 
to allow to remain, as they would probably be killed if forced to return to their tribes, 
some of them also have become attached to the men they are living with, and would be 
unwilling to leave them. 
There are various reports of a dreadful massacre, said to have taken place some years 
since, in which the stockmen are stated to have killed a great number of blacks; I have 
heard it said, as many as 200 were killed on that occasion. I saw the place in which they 
are 
are said to be buried. It is known by the name of Gravesend from the number of appearances
of graves. This massacre is said to have taken place previous to the first murder of two shepherds at Mr Cobb's station, and which, it is reported, was done in revenge for 
another outrage of a similar kind upon the blacks. Gravesend is a high mountain, situated 
about three miles from Mr. Cobb's head station on the Gwydir or Big River.
I always issued the strictest orders to my men not to interfere with the black 
Women; any man doing go in the camp would have been instantly put into irons.' (Mayne, Evidence to Committee on Police and Gaols 5.9.1839, pp 22-24, V&P 1839, V&P pp 22-24)
<br>
Mayne's version makes it clear that unusually large numbers of people could have been killed. He estimated 2000 to 3000 Gamilaraay lived in this region and he had witnessed up to 700 gather at a time. The war party against Cobb's Station was said to be 1000 strong. Mayne mentions that 'I believe two or three attacks had been made on them by the overseers and stock men within a few weeks on that part 
of the river'. From the slightly disjoint narrative, it's not clear if Mayne is describing the same, or two two distinct events at Ardgowan Plains and Gravesend in the lead up to the killing of shepherds at Cobb's station.",-29.554,150.306,1837-10-15,1837-10-31,"Gunson, 1974, vol.1, p. 145 <a href=""https://hunterlivinghistories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/threlkeld-gunson-2vols-newscan.pdf"">https://hunterlivinghistories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/threlkeld-gunson-2vols-newscan.pdf</a>;  The Sydney Herald, 10 Dec 1838, p 2 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12859902""> https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12859902</a> Milliss 1992, p 159; Mayne, Evidence to Committee on Police and Gaols 5.9.1839, V&P 1839.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=624,2024-06-01 00:06:21,2024-11-17 15:29:54,624,Gamilaraay (Gomeroi),NSW,NSW,Wallis Plains (Maitland),October 1837,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,150,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Stockmen/Drover(s),Horse,Reprisal,"Firearm(s), Musket(s), Sword(s), Blade(s)",**,4 stockmen; 2 assigned to George Bowman at Terry Hie Hie staton and 2 assigned to John Cobb at Anambah station on the Gwydir River. end to man at Terry Hie Hie station  s,,,,,,72,15,8,Gomeroi,Big River/Gwydir,Gomeroi: Big River/Gwydir,East,South

The massacre took place at the end of a month-long operation by mounted police in search of Aboriginal warriors led by Major J W Nunn (Milliss 1992, pp 183-96). In the ensuing inquiry into the massacre, Sergeant John Lee said that 'from forty to fifty blacks were killed.' (<i>HRA, I</i>, XX, p 251).

117,td6294,1336,Biniguy,Site,"On the 5th of September, 1839, Edward Denny Day, Police Magistrate of Muswellbrook gave evidence to the Committee on Police and Gaols. He spoke of the country being in a state of warfare and mentioned three massacre sites prior to the massacre at Myall Creek: Vinegar Hill, Slaughterhouse Creek and Gravesend, committed by groups of mounted and armed stockmen:
<br>
'It was represented to me, and I believe truly, that the blacks had been repeatedly pursued by parties of mounted and armed stockmen, assembled for the purpose, and that great numbers of them had been killed at various spots, particularly at Vinegar Hill, Slaughter-house Creek, and Gravesend, places so called by the stockmen, in commemoration of the deeds enacted there' (Day, Evidence to Committee on Police and Gaols 5.9.1839, p 224).
<br>
Descriptions of the massacre at Slaughterhouse Creek often describe it as an extended expedition of colonists aiming to finding and kill Aboriginal people. The headwaters of Slaughterhouse creek and the mouth of Slaughterhouse Creek, where it joins the Gwydir River at Biniguy, are both mentioned as massacre sites. Since this was an extended expedition it is reasonable to think both of these locations are massacre sites rather than it being one or the other. In Day's evidence, he mentions Vinegar Hill as a separate site to both Slaughterhouse Creek and Gravesend. Gravesend is a site reported by others. In his notes on p 811, Millis suggests 'Vinegar Hill' may be Biniguy or 'Binegar' (Millis, 1992, p 811). The word is phonetically similar, so colonists may have, after the massacre, corrupted the name to associate it with the Vinegar Hill uprising in the early colony of Sydney, named in turn after a battle in the Irish uprising, or Denny Day or the court scribe may simply have misheard it as 'Vinegar'. No other likely location for 'Vinegar Hill' in this region has been identified.

153,td0ce2,1336,Slaughterhouse Creek,Site,"On the 10th of September, 1838, Edward Denny Day sent a letter from the Muswellbrook Police Office to the Colonial Secretary in relation to the Myall Creek massacre. This letter described a 'war of extermination' in the area around the time of the Slaughterhouse creek massacre: 'It will be my duty in my next letter to offer with the permission of his Excellency some observation on the present lawless state of the neighbourhood of the Big River [Gwydir River]. Indeed I am almost justified in stating that a war of extermination has been carrying on there against the blacks who neglect no opportunity of retaliating by destroying the cattle of the settlers' (Day, Letter to Colonial Secretary, 10 September 1838). 'Big River' was the early colonial name for the Gwydir River.
<br>
On the 5th of September, 1839, Day as Police Magistrate of Muswellbrook gave evidence to the Committee on Police and Gaols. He spoke of the country being in a state of warfare and mentioned three massacre sites prior to the massacre at Myall Creek: Vinegar Hill, Slaughterhouse Creek and Gravesend, committed by groups of mounted and armed stockmen:
<br>
'I was engaged during part of the last year in inquiring into the circumstances of the murder of a number of blacks, at the Big River, between two hundred and three hundred miles from the settled districts. I was engaged in the investigation and journey forty-seven days. That part of the country appeared to me to be in a most unsettled state; the whites seemed to feel that they were in an enemy's country, and were afraid to move out of their huts without fire arms, and the huts were provided with loop-holes, to fire through, in the event of their being attacked. The blacks had at that time committed many outrages; I think four stockmen or shepherds had been murdered, and cattle speared in great numbers on many of the runs; and sheep had also been driven away; but I have reason to know that these outrages had been fully and fearfully avenged. It was represented to me, and I believe truly, that the blacks had been repeatedly pursued by parties of mounted and armed stockmen, assembled for the purpose, and that great numbers of them had been killed at various spots, particularly at Vinegar Hill, Slaughter-house Creek, and Gravesend, places so called by the stockmen, in commemoration of the deeds enacted there. The murder I was sent to investigate took place at Myall Creek, Mr. Henry Danger's cattle station, where twenty-eight blacks—men, women, and children—were killed. The whole party of stockmen, twelve in number, who were engaged in this dreadful deed, were apprehended, except one; and seven of them were executed. At the time of my visit, the blacks and whites were alike exasperated against each other; in fact, the country was, I may say, in a state of warfare. It had been then occupied not much more than two years, and as the blacks were decidedly friendly at first, as was shown by their assisting in forming many of the stations, by stripping bark and in other ways, I can only account for the hostility that existed subsequently, by attributing it to the interference on the part of some of the stockmen with their women, which the blacks revenged on the first unprotected white persons who fell in their way' (Day, Evidence to Committee on Police and Gaols 5.9.1839, V&P 1839, p 224).
<br>
According to the author of the Wallabadah manuscript, most likely William Telfer, an early colonist in the area, 'the stations on the Mcintyre were not long occupied when the aboriginals began to be very hostile and to be agresive to the whites the cause was the Masacre of the blacks at slaughter house creek on the Big River where they ran the blacks into the Stockyard and destroyed them without mercy' (Telfer, 1980, p 37).
<br>
According to historian RHW Reece, (Reece, 1974, p.34), the Slaughterhouse Creek massacre was part of 'The Bushwhack or The Drive' that took place in the months following Major Nunn's expedition and the Waterloo Creek massacre on 26 January 1838.
<br>
A massacre at Slaughterhouse Creek is widely recorded in local oral history and folklore. Roger Milliss summarises the various accounts in his book <i>Waterloo Creek</i> (Milliss, 1992, pp 198-203) noting that some involve a detailed chronology. These accounts suggest that 'The Bushwhack... continued without let-up for four to five weeks, with men in the saddle day after day pursuing the hunt. But towards the end of May or early in June, as they swept across the east past Terry Hie Hie, they suddenly realised the blacks had slipped through the net.' Hearing of a hidden ravine, 'A party of fifteen heavily armed stockmen, so the story goes, made their way through the bush in the dead of night and quietly surrounded the gorge, in much the same way as Nunn and Cobban had set up their nocturnal ambush on the Namoi five months earlier. A large number of Aborigines, several hundred apparently, were asleep in the bed of the creek below. When daylight came the fifteen whites positioned on the steep slopes on either side opened up on them with muskets, carbines and shotguns, then clambered down and completed their murderous work with pistols, swords and cutlasses. Up to 300 people are said to have perished' (Milliss, 1992, p 202). As it was a long expedition, it is possible that killing occurred at both the stockyard mentioned in Telfer's account and the ravine mentioned in local oral history, or that the story has changed over time. While the number 300 may be an exaggeration, considering that there was a sustained period of killing, or that in both versions the victims were trapped in a small space and killed by a well-armed and coordinated group of colonists, the death toll would be high.
<br>
According to Milliss there are various versions of the folk tradition of a long campaign covering a large area of Gomeroi country (Milliss, 1992, pp 200-201). One of these is by C.F. Boughton in his serialisation of Moree history in the North West Champion in 1949 and 1951. Broughton wrote, 'I have mentioned the foregoing facts because they give a better understanding of what led up to the Slaughterhouse Creek massacre, that, like the Umbercollie attempt to settle differences, was a reprisal on a larger scale than any other that we have any knowledge of in this district. It was undertaken by district squatters and their stockmen. By the use of slashing whips, and with guns in reserve, the natives were driven into a yard and then shot. From my father, who got the story from those who came to the district before him, I understand that a large number of natives were slaughtered, and in my early boyhood heard men say that bones were still to be seen strewn around the scene of the massacre. My father told us that those guilty were brought to trial, and on some fault in the indictment were acquitted, but on a second trial were found guilty and condemned to death. The creek and the run on which these things occurred now bear the name of Slaughterhouse Creek. The Gwydir Highway crosses this creek about a mile eastward from Biniguy, but the tragedy took place several miles upstream from where the highway crosses the creek' (North West Champion, 20 Oct 1949, p 10).
<br>
There are two main locations mentioned in relation to Slaughterhouse Creek where a large amount of people were killed. One is at a stockyard near the junction of Slaughterhouse Creek and the Gwydir River, and the other is at the headwaters of Slaughterhouse Creek in a ravine. The narratives in local 'folk' history (Millis, 1992, pp 198-203) say that there was killing at multiple locations, which accords with the official evidence of a 'war of extermination' and roving bands of armed mounted colonists who would shoot on sight, so it's reasonable to think killing occurred at both these distinct sites, and possibly more. Police Magistrate Day's evidence mentions 'Vinegar Hill'. There is no information available indicating a place of that name in the area. In his notes on p 811, Milliss suggests 'Vinegar Hill' may be Biniguy or 'Binegar'. The word is phonetically similar, so colonists may have, after the massacre, euphemistically corrupted the name to associate it with the Vinegar Hill uprising in the early colony of Sydney, named in turn after a battle in the Irish uprising, or Denny Day or the committee scribe may simply have misheard it as 'Vinegar'.
<br>
Edward Mayne estimated the population of Gomeroi people in the area to be 2,000 and 3,000 persons and had seen 700 gathered at a time (Mayne, Evidence to Committee on Police and Gaols 5.9.1839, pp 22-24). These high populations and concentrations indicate a high death toll is reasonable, particularly considering the confined space with little avenue of escape and that the colonists had assembled a large, mounted and well armed force for the purpose of finding and killing Aboriginal people.",-29.708,150.333,1838-05-01,1838-06-07,"Reece 1974, p.34; Telfer, 1980; Day, Letter to Colonial Secretary, 31 July 1838, SRNSW CSO CSR 38/9458 Telfer, 1980; Milliss 1992, pp 200-3; Day, Letter to Colonial Secretary, 10 September 1838, SRNSW CSO CSR 38/9458; Mayne, Evidence to Committee on Police and Gaols 5.9.1839, pp 22-4, NSWLC V&P 1839; Day, Evidence to Committee on Police and Gaols 5.9.1839, p 224, NSWLC V&P 1839;  North West Champion, 20 Oct 1949, p 10 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/184173250"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/184173250</a>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=578,2024-06-01 00:06:21,2024-11-17 15:29:53,578,Gamilaraay,NSW,NSW,Scone,March 1838,Dawn,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,200,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Stockmen/Drover(s),Horse,Opportunity,"Musket(s), Pistol(s), Sword(s), Cutlass/Cutlasses",**,,,,,1838: Slaughterhouse Creek,,72,15,8,Gomeroi,Big River/Gwydir,Gomeroi: Big River/Gwydir,East,South
154,td0ce4,1336,Myall Creek,Site,"In the absence of William Hobbs, the overseer of Myall Creek station on the Gwydir River, twelve horsemen galloped into the station late on Sunday afternoon 10 June 1838 and tied up 28 Wirayaraay old men, women and children and forced them to walk to an area out of sight of the station huts. The horsemen then fired at the tied up people with pistols and fowling pieces and then hacked and bludgeoned them to death with swords and cutlasses. Then they rode off and returned next day and  burnt the bodies. The massacre was led by settler John Henry Fleming and eleven stockmen; John Russell, Charles Kilmeister, Edward Foley, Charles Toulouse, James Oates, William Hawkins, John Johnstone, James Parry, John Blake, Edward Palliser and William Lamb. When Hobbs returned to Myall Creek station three days later, he was told about the massacre by hut keeper Charles Anderson and after viewing the burnt bodies, Hobbs wrote  a letter reporting the massacre to the  Colonial Secretary in Sydney who ordered an investigation by magistrate Edward Denny Day. The ringleader, John Henry Fleming disappeared before Day arrived in the region, leaving the 11 stockmen to take the rap. They were arrested and charged with murder and taken to Sydney for trial in the Supreme Court. However two trials were required before seven of them were convicted and hanged on 18 December 1838. This is the only known case in NSW where  perpetrators of a frontier massacre of Aboriginal people were convicted and hanged.  Myall Creek is the best known massacre event in Australia.  Beginning in 2000, the massacre is acknowledged every June in a public ceremony  of remembrance at the massacre site. The ceremony is attended by, among others, descendants of the perpetrators and victims in a gesture of reconciliation.

As their appearance looked hostile, they returned to camp. I directed Mr Macalister, Mr Haughton, Patrick, Jungle, Rodney and Coreen Jemmy, to get some horses saddled. In the meanwhile Jemmy Cangara mounted a tree, to observe the movement of the blacks. He reported that they were stretching out in a half moon, in three parties. This move, which my men term stockyarding, is, I believe, peculiar to blacks throwing spears with a woomera, the object being to concentrate the shower of spears. It was one long familiar to me, and I directed Mr Macalister to charge their left wing. The result was that the circular line doubled up, the blacks turned and fled.

In the latter lot there was one black who would not die after receiving eighteen or twenty bullets, but a trooper speedily put an end to his existence by smashing his skull. In the camp of the last lot of blacks, Mr. Uhr found a compass belonging to a Mr. Manson of the Norman, and a revolver belonging to a Chinaman. He then followed the tracks of the sheep Manson and the Chinaman had a short time before passed with, and in a waterhole found the bodies of poor Manson and the Chinaman cut about and mutilated in a most frightful manner. Cameron's body has also been found. In this expedition I am informed Mr. Uhr was accompanied by Mr Hetzer, who has been very kind and indulgent to the myalls for a long time, but now sees his folly.

According to Tony Roberts (2005, pp16-17):
""As the horse party with four of the men made camp beside a deep creek in the late afternoon, Aboriginals were heard calling out from along the creek. Cox and Ah Choo readied themselves to guard the horses, while Uhr and Barry rode across to the far bank intending to find and confront whoever was there. Each man was armed with a rifle and a revolver. A boomerang was thrown, narrowly missing Barry, and as he charged his horse at the assailant a large number of Aboriginals ran up towards them from the creek bed and the shooting began. The Aboriginals retreated but then emerged on the other side of the creek, trying to surround Cox and Ah Choo. They were driven off and chased back along the creek by Uhr and Barry. 
It was Uhr's custom in situations like this not merely to drive the Aboriginals off but to 'teach them a lesson'.""
Each man was armed with a .45 calibre rifle and a pistol. Uhr had a Martini-Henry rifle which could fire accurately to 1000 yards and Barry had a Westley Richards which could fire up to 400 yards. 
Barry later published an edited account of the expedition in the <i>Brisbane Courier</i> (October 27, 1874, p 3).

Our country was well suited to grazing cattle and by 1874 permanent pastoral occupation had been established. Much of their settlement on country was not done peacefully. As more settlers came it became harder for us to access the places we visited for food and water. Our Elders were chased away and even shot at and killed. We called this time is [sic] our history Wabulinji ('Wild Time') and is especially painful as our people struggled and died fighting to stay on country and keep their families alive.'

In the night the Blacks attacked the horses wounding three of ours and killing three of the other peoples. The damage was discovered at daylight in the morning and as soon as our horses could be saddled their tracks were followed from where they had cut up the horses, through the wet grass, about 8 miles to their camp on a lagoon. There were five rifles and a Blackfellow with a knife and tomahawk and the result was out of a possible 200, 90 killed and wounded in the camp besides what wounded escaped.

The fleeing group went to the top of the Abner Range, thinking the horses would not be able to reach the top. The horsemen did find a way to the top and followed the tracks left behind to an Aboriginal camp. Roberts wrote: 'The men, in pairs, formed a half-circle around the sleeping camp – some of them as close as 20 metres. On the far side of the camp was a sheer, 150-metre drop. The numerous small fires were evidence of a large number of people. Curtis said he would fire first, as soon as it was light enough to see. Shooting sleeping victims at first light was a standard method. Exhausted, the occupants of the camp slept soundly. But, at times, according to Gaunt, ""we could hear a piccanninny cry and the lubra crooning to it"". When it was finally light enough to see, an Aboriginal man sat up and stretched his arms. ""Smith fired and the police boy with me fired at the sitting Abo. The black bounced off the ground and fell over into the fire, stone dead. Then pandemonium started. Blacks were rushing to all points only to be driven back with a deadly fire…One big Abo, over six feet, rushed toward the boy and I. I dropped him in his tracks with a well-directed shot. Later on, when we went through the camp to count the dead and despatch the wounded, I walked over to this big Abo and was astonished to find, instead of a buck, that it was a splendidly built young lubra about, I should judge, sixteen or eighteen years of age. The bullet had struck her on the bridge of the nose and penetrated to the brain. She never knew what hit her…When the melee was over, we counted fifty-two dead and mortally wounded. For mercy's sake, we despatched the wounded. Twelve more we found at the foot of the cliff fearfully mangled.""  Below the cliff was the head of a creek, which Tom Lynott named Malakoff Creek, after a bloody battle during the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War. When a camp was attacked in daylight, the whites were usually mounted and, unless the country was open and flat, it was often possible for a number of occupants to escape. In some cases, they watched in horror, unseen, as whites dispatched the wounded. Adults and children received a bullet to the brain, while babies – whether injured or not – were held by the ankles ""just like goanna"", their skulls smashed against trees or rocks. A crying baby left behind when Garrwa people fled a camp on the Robinson River was thrown onto the hot coals of a cooking fire, still crying' (Roberts, 2009, np).",-16.7,135.88,1892-01-01,1892-12-31,"<a href=""https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2009/november/1330478364/tony-roberts/brutal-truth#mtr"">Roberts, 2009, np</a>.

It was widely believed that station worker George William Clarke and the station cook Charles Deloitte were killed at Bowgan Station by Aboriginal workers 'Walter' and 'Monkeyboy'. Two reprisal massacres took place in pursuit of the alleged killers. 
The first was at Corella Creek on Bowgan Station, and led by station owner, Tom Perry. According to Charles Gaunt, 'Walter' and 'Monkeyboy' sought refuge with  a group of Aboriginal people who were not involved in the killings.
<br>
'The party on the way to Bowgun crossed Corella Creek, eighteen miles from Brunette and just at that particular time a big mob of blacks had come in from the Westward and was camped at the big hole about a mile and a half below the crossing. The party discovered the blacks and the. blood lust being strong in these men, thirsting for revenge, they rounded up these blacks, innocent of any crime at the time, and shot down bucks, lubras and piccaninnies. The terrified blacks jumping into the water hole were slaughtered in dozens. (This was told to me a short time afterwards at Eva Downs by three of the party, one being Tom Perry). The party then proceeded on the way leaving the camp a shambles and the waterhole a grave for those shot in it'  (Gaunt, February 19, 1932, p 2),

'Walter' was killed in the reprisal massacre. Monkey Boy escaped and died of natural causes.

This was the second massacre, led by Tom Perry and pastoralists/station workers in reprisal for Aboriginal people known to colonists as 'Walter' and 'Monkey Boy' killing George William Clarke and Charles Deloitte at Creswell Down Station on 30 January 1892.  
The massacre took place at Fish Creek on the  Nicholson River.

Gaunt, in the <i>Northern Standard</i> of 19 February 1932, (p 3) described the previous 'Corella' massacre as 'one of the largest, if not the largest, in the history of the Northern Territory' and said that 'dozens' of Aboriginal people were killed, including 'bucks, lubras and picanninies'. This massacre appears to be of similar if not greater proportions.

'They slaughtered the blacks with the same zeal that they killed the blacks on Corella Creek. Following the natives up from camp to camp, killing on sight until the blood lust was appeased.

131,td0c9c,1336,"Warrigal Creek, Gippsland",Site,"In early July 1843, Donald Macalister, the nephew of squatter Lachlan Macalister, was killed by Aboriginal people, near Port Albert in Gippsland. According to GA Robinson, who first heard of Macalister's killing from Crown Lands Commissioner Charles Tyers on 19 May 1844,' Mr McAllister was murdered about six months ago by the natives; he was alone it seems and on horseback and supposed riding serenely along and E.H. the black took him by surprise or he must have been parleing with them a the time it happened. He had a brace of pistols in his holster, [when] his body was found, he was on his way to the Port [Albert] with cattle in short way on ahead' (Robinson 19 May 1844, in Clark 1998d, p.56).
<br>
After being visited by Thomas McAllister and Mr McMillan at Foster's, Robinson remarked in his journal on 1 June, 1844, 'Reginald McAllister was the gentleman killed by natives; they are supposed to have killed him with sticks; there was no spear wounds no person saw it done or saw natives; hence there is no direct proof' (Clark, 1998d, p 73). Robinson listed several other colonists killed. According to Gippsland historian Peter D Gardner, Macalister's death was at least the fifth killing of a colonist in Gippsland within 12 months (Gardner 2001, p.53). McMillan had been the first European to the region in 1839, and the earliest runs were established soon after, such that these murders were in direct response to the first few years of colonial incursion.
<br>
A visitor to Gippsland wrote in 1843 'I had been informed that ill-blood existed between the blacks and settlers, and that four
or five shepherds and stock-men had been murdered; that it was unsafe to travel alone and unarmed in Gipps' Land' (The Courier, 23 Jun, 1843, p 4).

In 1845 William Thomas, the Assistant Protector of Aborigines recorded in his journal that 'He said he [Hatcher] and another man had come unarmed from Gippsland.

<br>
Macalister's death prompted a massacre of Aboriginal people, most likely at multiple sites around Warrigal Creek. Bell, in 1874, wrote as if the massacre was well known in the colony:
<br>
'The historic pen of Victorian settlement would paint with truth the horrors of many
a scene of Gipps Land life; and it was in 1843 (the year the will was dated) that the aggressions
of the blacks were so frequent. Shepherds worked in pairs, armed, as if in an enemy's
country, to resist them ; and it was 1843 that ended by wholesale destruction, the massacres at
Warrigal Creek and the Bundalaguah Swamp, where only one aboriginal was left to tell the
story of how they died and the history of his race' (The Age, 8 Aug, 1874, p 7).
<br>
Dunderdale, writing in the late 1800s, provides the following description of events:
<br>
'At this time the blacks had quite recovered from the fright occasioned by the discharge of the nine-pounder gun, and were again often seen from the huts at the Old Port. Donald Macalister was sent by his uncle, Lachlan Macalister, of Nuntin, to make arrangements for shipping some cattle and sheep. The day before their arrival Donald saw some blacks at a distance in the scrub, and without any provocation fired at them with an old Tower musket, charged with shot. The next day the drovers and shepherds arrived with the stock, and drove them over Glengarry's bridge to a place between the Tarra and Albert rivers, called the Coal Hole, afterwards occupied by Parson Bean. there was no yard there, and the animals would require watching at night; so Donald decided to send them back to Glengarry's yards. Then he and the drovers and shepherds would have a pleasant time; there would be songs and whisky, the piper would play, and the men and maids would dance. The arrangement suited everybody. The drovers started back with the cattle, Donald helped the shepherds to gather the sheep, and put them on the way, and then he rode after the cattle. The track led him past a grove of dense ti-tree, on the land now known as the Brewery Paddock, and about a hundred yards ahead a single blackfellow came out of the grove, and began capering about and waving a waddy. Donald pulled up his horse and looked at the black. He had a pair of pistols in the holsters of his saddle, but he did not draw them: there was no danger from a blackfellow a hundred yards off. But there was another behind him and much nearer, who came silently out of the ti-tree and thrust a spear through Donald's neck. The horse galloped away towards Glengarry's bridge.
<br>
'When the drovers saw the riderless horse, they supposed that Macalister had been accidentally thrown, and they sent Friday to look for him. He found him dead. The blacks had done their work quickly. They had stripped Donald of everything but his trousers and boots, had mutilated him in their usual fashion, and had disappeared. A messenger was sent to old Macalister, and the young man was buried on the bank of the river near McClure's grave. The new cemetery now contained three graves, the second being that of Tinker Ned, who shot himself accidentally when pulling out his gun from beneath a tarpaulin.
<br>
'Lachlan Macalister had had a long experience in dealing with blackfellows and bushrangers; he had been a captain in the army, and an officer of the border police. The murder of his nephew gave him both a professional and a family interest in chastising the criminals, and he soon organised a party to look for them. It was, of course, impossible to identify any blackfellow concerned in the outrage, and therefore atonement must be made by the tribe. The blacks were found encamped near a waterhole at Gammon Creek, and those who were shot were thrown into it, to the number, it was said, of about sixty, men, women, and children; but this was probably an exaggeration. At any rate, the black who capered about to attract young Macalister's attention escaped, and he often afterwards described and imitated the part he took in what he evidently considered a glorious act of revenge. The gun used by old Macalister was a double-barrelled Purdy, a beautiful and reliable weapon, which in its time had done great execution' (Dunderdale, 2020). McMillan showed Robinson his gun on 5 June 1844. It had 'seven barralls (sic): all go off at once' (Clark 1998d, p.94).
<br>
A more detailed account of the events was published in <i>The Gap</i> magazine's 1925 edition in an article titled 'Experiences with Gippsland Blacks'. The article on the Warrigal Creek massacre was submitted under the pen name 'Gippslander, Bairnsdale'. Gippslander wrote:  
<br>
'When Angus McMillan first settled in Gippsland in 1839, the blacks were very numerous, hostile, and treacherous. They speared the stock and attacked 
the homesteads, and, in some instances, speared some of the hut-keepers. The white settlers retaliated, and there were numerous raids on the blacks, and numbers of them were killed, mostly around McLennan's Straits, Roseneath, and the western shores of Lake Wellington. 
Getting well into the forties, settlement was taking place south from Sale and north from Port Albert. The blacks were becoming more civilised, and many of them used to congregate about the stations. Shipping was coming from Van Diemen's Land, and elsewhere, bringing in a number of undesirables - ""ticket-of-leave"" men, or ""Vandemonians,"" as they were called in those days.
These men [Vandemonians] were employed by the settlers as hutkeepers, and some of them used to treat the blacks 
badly, playing all sorts of practical jokes upon them, 
which in many instances amounted to cruelty. Most 
of the outrages committed by the blacks at that time 
were the outcome of some injury, either real or 
fancied, committed by those men on the natives. 
The murder of 
Roland Macalister was in revenge for 
the throwing of hot ashes on the 
feet of the natives by Macalister's 
hut-keeper. Macalister at that time 
was stationed some distance out from 
Port Albert and had one of these 
""ticket-of-leave"" men as hut-keeper. 
The former used to visit Port Albert, returning after dark, and the 
blacks were aware 
of this. The hut-keeper, during Macalister's absence, was in the habit of letting the blacks inside the hut. 
On this particular night, when he wanted them 
to go out, they refused, so he took some hot ashes, 
which he threw over their bare feet. 
In revenge they made up their minds to kill Macalister. Three 
of them waited for him as he returned, putting 
three spears through him and killing him at once. 
Taking most of his clothes and his kidney fat, they 
made for Warrigal Creek. 
Macalister's horse, taking fright, galloped off along 
the road towards Sale, and, next day, was found 
between Woodside and Sale by Mr. McMillan, 
who was traveling down the road with cattle. The 
blacks must have had some way of communicating 
with the others, for the morning after the murder 
not a black was to be seen on any of the stations; 
all had made for Warrigal Creek. The settlers were 
so enraged at this murder that they determined to 
give the blacks a lesson, and formed what they 
called the Highland Brigade. Every man who could 
find a gun and a horse took chase after the blacks. 
The Brigade, coming up to the blacks, camped 
around the waterhole at Warrigal Creek, 
rounded them, and fired into them, killing a great 
number. Some escaped in the scrub, others jumped 
into the waterhole, and, as fast as they put their 
heads up for breath, they were shot, until the water 
was red with blood. It was estimated that between 
one hundred and one hundred and fifty were killed 
during the progress of the Brigade. 
I knew two blacks who, though wounded, came 
out of that hole alive. 
One was a boy at that time, 
about 12 or 14 years old. He was hit in the eye 
by a slug, captured by the whites, and made to lead 
the Brigade on from one camp to another. He was 
afterwards adopted by one of the party and was 
called ""Bing Eye."" 
The other was a little older; 
he made his escape up the creek by swimming and 
diving. He was shot through the foot, and was so 
injured that he was called ""Club Foot."" 
After this slaughter the blacks kept to the coast, 
and did not come near the stations for a number of 
years. The spearing of cattle, however, still went 
on, and there were still many blacks 
being killed, principally by the Black 
Police' (Gippslander, Bairnsdale, 1925).
<br>
Dunderdale names Macalister's uncle 'Lachlan Macalister' as having lead the massacre while, Gippslander names 'McMillan'. All accounts indicate that many colonists in the area were involved.  
<br>
In another reminiscence in the same magazine titled 'My Early Life', Mrs H. Greenwood wrote, 'I remember the blacks killing Mr Macalister, and the subsequent slaughter of the blacks at Warrigal Creek.' Mrs Greenwood says she was born in 1853, some time after the massacre, so she must have meant that she remembered hearing of it, presumably from her father who she said had moved to Gippsland around 1840 (The Gap, 1925, p 11). Historian Peter Gardner notes that the massacre remained widely recognised in the folk history of Gippsland (Gardner, 1983, pp 53-62).
<br>
Caldow provides a detailed list of sources for the Warrigal Creek massacre, but is dismissive of the Gippslander's version, relied on heavily by Gardner, largely because it is published in a magazine for children (Caldow, 2020). Gardner has replied to Caldow in detail (Gardner, 2022). The intended readership of <i>The Gap</i> is schoolchildren, with a focus on factual education rather than fiction. The story of the Warrigal Creek massacre appears along with other non-fiction articles on diverse topics ranging from ANZAC Day and the use of gas in World War One to beekeeping and the sugar beet industry. These topics are not cast into doubt for being in an educational magazine. As a Gippsland publication, the magazine includes a section providing members of the community an opportunity to contribute their knowledge and reminiscences towards a history of the region. The Gippslander article also mentions other attested violence in Gippsland at 'McLennan's Straits, Roseneath, and the western shores of Lake Wellington', and historical events such as the influx of Vandemonians and the murder of Macalister. Caldow acknowledges that, 'First, using the information Gardner misinterpreted, rejected or missed in Thomas, Dunderdale and Bell, we must accept the possibility or even the probability that an atrocity took place somewhere' and suggests 'Establishing the factual basis of this will require in-depth research to uncover any written evidence before Bell's account from 1874, as well as archaeological evidence at locations such as Bruthen Creek and Bundalaguah Swamp' (Caldow, 2020). 
<br>
The creeks mentioned in various tellings of the massacre are all relatively close together. This is consistent with Gippslander's statement that the colonists had progressed from one camp to another. This could be seen as a single massacre at multiple sites, referred to by the name of any one of the creeks in the area, or as a group of massacres that were part of a single expedition. Caldow (2020) and Gardner (2022) concur that the station where 'might be gath.rd up' referred to in Thomas's journal is Hatcher's brother in law Buntine's run at Bruthen Creek.
<br>
The earliest accounts then give the locations as Bruthen Creek, Warrigal Creek and Gammon Creek. Gardner lists several sites that are mentioned in local folk history and where archaeological evidence has been found. First,  Warrigal Creek at a long U shaped waterhole which matches Gippslander's description (Gardner, 1983, p 53). Next, Warrigal Creek mouth, where a large quantity of Aboriginal bones of men, women and children were found with similar skull fractures. This led local historian the Rev. George Cox to conclude that it was not the result of a tribal massacre, but may be a result of the massacres following Macalister's murder (Gardner, 1983, p 53-54). Then Red Hill, where skeletons were found in an upright position, which Gardner regards as inconsistent with traditional Kurnai funereal practice. However, Gardner discounts this site as it is unrealistic that people could have been surrounded and not escaped (Gardner, 1983, p 55). Then Gammon Creek: as well as being named as the location by Dunderdale, there is a strong local tradition that a massacre occurred here (Gardner, 1983, p 56). Finally, Freshwater Creek: an Aboriginal survivor named Darby had told Chas Lucas who told the Rev. Cox this was the location (Gardner, 1983, p 57).
<br>
The most likely sites at which people were killed, based on a combination of historical records, archaeology and local oral history is then: Warrigal Creek, Warrigal Creek Mouth, Gammon Creek, Freshwater Creek and Bruthen Creek.
<br>
Gardner further notes the rapid decline in numbers of people of the Brataualung Clan of Kurnai Nations: 'Beginning with the pre-white estimates of population at 300-500 the total of these people, within 30 years of the initial white occupation numbered 17. By 1880 there were only two surviving members' (Gardner, 1983, p 58). The determined manner in which these reprisal massacres were carried out and the sudden extreme decline in population indicate that unusually large numbers of people were killed in the Warrigal Creek massacres.",-38.465,147.011,1843-07-01,1843-07-31,"Dunderdale, 1973, p.225; Pepper and de Aurugo, 1985, p.24;  Cannon, 1990, p.171;  Shaw,1996, p.133; Clark, 1998d, p.70, p. 99, p.110; Gardner, 2001, pp 53-61;  Bartrop, 2004, pp 199-205 ; The Age, 8 Aug 1874, p 7 <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/201532298'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/201532298</a>;

331,td0c9d,1336,Warrigal Creek Mouth,Site,"In his review of the various accounts of the Warrigal Creek massacres Gippsland historian Peter Gardner quotes a report that human remains were found at the mouth of Warrigal Creek (Gardner, 2001, pp 53-57). He cites an article in the Gippsland Standard and Alberton Shire Representative in 1912 by the Rev, George Cox, where Cox says that a local teacher, W. H. Thomas,  and a friend M had dug up a large quantity of human bones including remains of men, women and children. According to Gardner, Cox says the bones were 'evidently Aboriginal' and adds 'As a result of a careful examination of these it was disclosed that all the skulls were fractured, a piece being broken away at the base of the skull, as though caused by a blow from a tomahawk. Messrs. Thomas and Lamb concluded at first that the remains were those of aboriginals killed in a tribal fight; but that was discounted by the remarkable resemblance of the skull fractures. From Mr. Chas Kuch, senior, they afterwards heard of a massacre of blacks in that neighbourhood. Mr. Thomas suggests that this information may throw light on the scene of the massacre which took place in revenge for the murder of Ronald Macalister' (Cox cited in Gardner, 1983, pp 53-54).
<br>
From this description, the regularity of the fractures and their location at the base of the skull are analogous to fractured skulls found in the Cambodian killing fields, described in a 2006 study 'Blunt Force Cranial Trauma in the Cambodian Killing Fields' (Ta'ala et al, 2006). This similarity suggests the possibility that at the mouth of Warrigal Creek victims were restrained and executed with a blow to the head, possibly to save bullets.",-38.482,147.033,1843-07-01,1843-07-31,"Dunderdale, 1973, p.225; Pepper and de Aurugo, 1985, p.24;  Cannon, 1990, p.171;  Shaw,1996, p.133; Clark, 1998d, p.70, p. 99, p.110; Gardner, 2001, pp 53-61;  Bartrop, 2004, pp 199-205 ; The Age, 8 Aug 1874, p 7 <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/201532298'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/201532298</a>;

According to Dunderdale, following the killing of Donald Macalister, Aborginal people were massacred at Gammon Creek.
'Lachlan Macalister had had a long experience in dealing with blackfellows and bushrangers; he had been a captain in the army, and an officer of the border police. The murder of his nephew gave him both a professional and a family interest in chastising the criminals, and he soon organised a party to look for them. It was, of course, impossible to identify any blackfellow concerned in the outrage, and therefore atonement must be made by the tribe. The blacks were found encamped near a waterhole at Gammon Creek, and those who were shot were thrown into it, to the number, it was said, of about sixty, men, women, and children; but this was probably an exaggeration. At any rate, the black who capered about to attract young Macalister's attention escaped, and he often afterwards described and imitated the part he took in what he evidently considered a glorious act of revenge. The gun used by old Macalister was a double-barrelled Purdy, a beautiful and reliable weapon, which in its time had done great execution' (Dunderdale, 2020).
<br>

137,td0cb0,1336,Snowy River,Site,"In 1846, rumours reached Melbourne that a white woman, the possible survivor of a shipwreck on the Gippsland coast, had been kidnapped by Kurnai people and become the trophy of a headman, Bungalene. After the failure of an expedition led by Crown Lands Commissioner Charles Tyers, to find the white woman, two other expeditions were organised. One, a private expedition, led by Christian de Villiers and James Warman, along with six Aboriginal warriors from Westernport, and three from Gippsland and three colonists, Mr Brodie, Mr Peters and Thomas Hill, set off from Melbourne on foot in early December 1846. The other, a division of Native Police led by William Dana left headquarters at Narre Warren east of Melbourne on November 21, 1846. Historian of the Native Police, Marie Hansen Fels who provides the most detailed account of the events at the Snowy River, says that what Dana and his division did in the weeks between leaving Narre Warren and prior to the incident on 20 December is unknown (Fels 1988, p 188). The two parties met up on 15 December at Eagle Point on Lake King, where de Villiers suggested to Dana that they join forces and make the sixty miles journey to the Snowy River by water where it was believed the white woman and Bungalene were camped. But Dana refused and de Villiers and his party left that evening at 6pm (Fels 1988, p.188).
Foul weather led de Villiers to split his party in two: Warman and the three colonists would wait until the weather improved and 'proceed then to the Snowy River by boat... while he pressed on overland' with the Westernport and Gippsland Aborigines (Fels 1988, p 188). On 21 December, de Villiers' party came upon Dana and his detachment of Native Police at the Snowy River at the reed beds in Lake Curlip country between Marlo and Orbost. Dana told de Villiers 'that he had surrounded several camps of natives, and taken five prisoners, an old man, and an old woman, and three children.' (Fels 1988, p 189).
<br>
Later the Aboriginal guides with de Villiers told him that Dana and his police had shot some of the Snowy River natives (Fels 1988, p 189). The next day the two parties separated, with Dana retracing his steps to the border police station, while de Villiers proceeded up the Snowy River, where his suspicions were alerted by the unusual sight of a large area of 'trampled reed-beds' and finding 'the dead and decomposing body of a very stout Aboriginal male, about thirty years of age,' with severe wounds to the head, leg and breast, 'which his blacks told him were gunshot wounds', inflicted by the Native Police. 'Upon his return to the Tambo River three days later, de Villiers heard from a Richard Hartnett that local Aborigines had said that Mr Dana's party had shot some blacks on the Snowy River.' (Fels 1988, p 189). James Warman, added further details regarding a carbine that he found, belonging to the Native Police, which was 'bloodied and broken, with tufts of black hair clinging to it' (Fels 1988, p 189).
<br>
Corporal Owen Cowan, a border policeman who accompanied Dana and the Native Police, said that on 19 December, he had 'a hand to hand struggle' with the Aborigines, and that 'he was speared in the hand, knocked to the ground and that he had lost his carbine, fired his pistol, then regained his carbine, hit his assailant over the head with it and barely escaped with his life.' (Fels 1988, p 189).
He also said that 'At the time, the police force was split three ways around the islands and the lake at the mouth of the Snowy River, and he had only one trooper with him' (Cowan in Fels 1988, p 190). Even so, they 'rushed' an Aboriginal camp but retreated under 'a shower of spears' (Cowan in Fels 1988, p 190). The following night, December 20, Cowan surrounded another Aboriginal camp, 'coming upon' it at sunrise (Cowan in Fels 1988, p 190). But he did not say what happened next. Nor did he say whether the entire group of Native Police were involved, although Dana did say that he considered that this was the only way he could determine whether the white woman from Gippsland was with them (Fels 1988, p 190). Warman's account indicates that at least five Aboriginal people were shot ('Port Phillip Herald', February 25, 1847). Fels is not persuaded that the attack on 20 December constitutes a massacre because only one Aboriginal person was recorded killed and that the number 'became some as the story was transmitted orally, and a slaughter when it appeared in the newspapers' (Fels 1988, p 193). However, she does admit, 'It is not satisfactory now that William Dana's original report (if it existed) is missing' (Fels 1988, p 191). That the missing report did exist is demonstrated by a cover letter from Dana to Police Magistrate Lonsdale, reading, '...a copy of a report of Mr William Dana Commanding 2nd Division Native Police Gippsland respecting a collision with the natives of that District while in search of the white woman...'(Dana to Latrobe, 1847). Commissioner Tyers considered that Dana did not act with prudence and Governor Gipps questioned both Dana's authority for acting as he did and his explanation – which was 'Not satisfactory'; he acted 'with great want of discretion, to say the least of it.' (quoted in Fels 1988, p 191).
<br>
According to Gippsland historian Peter D. Gardner, the number killed by the native police overall was between 15 and 23 (Gardner 1983, p.72). The event was much debated in the media at the time. Sergeant R. McLelland of the native police argued that one person was killed, and that the eight bodies in a camp that he and the native police and then de Villier came across were not murdered but were being carried around in accordance with Aboriginal funeral customs (McLelland, 16 February 1847). Warman responded that he had never seen more than one deceased person in a camp at one time and suggested Sergeant McLelland explain why there might be eight (Warman, 23 February 1847). A close reading of Warman's published reports indicates that nine Aboriginal people were killed in the period 20-21 December 1846 (Warman, 1847). Twelve years after the expeditions, Crown Lands Commissioner C.J. Tyers, to whom the police involved reported, while answering questions under oath for a Select Committee of the Legislative Council on the Aborigines, stated, ""At least fifty were killed by the native police and other aborigines attached to the parties in search of a white woman supposed to have been detained by the blacks, and a few by collision with the white people, from ten to fifteen years ago.""

173,td0d17,1336,"Paterson River, Hunter Valley",Site,"On 3 March 1827, the Sydney newspapers, the <i>Australian</i> and the <i>Monitor</i>, reported that Aboriginal people's dogs had been attacking sheep and that a shepherd on EG Cory's estate at the Paterson River in the Hunter Valley had killed a dog belonging to Aboriginal people (Wonnarua). In reprisal, Wonnarua warriors wounded the shepherd and set fire to grass and wheat on Mr Cory's estate. The newspapers added that 2 mounted police dispatched after the event were ineffective. On 22 March the <i>Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i> reported that, 'about a dozen black natives have been shot in the neighbourhood of Hunter's River, within 10 or 12 miles of Mr. Magistrate McLeod's estate;' and lamented that no Justice of the Peace was near enough to investigate. It added, 'The natives were in the act of retreating, laden with produce of the maize field, and were so courageous and impudent as to irritate the whites and attack them with spears, when, in self-defence (we believe) twelve of the blacks were left dead on the field.' Two days later on 24 March, the <i>Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i> connected this incident with Mr Cory's property, saying that flocks had been attacked by dogs and spears were thrown at the shepherd. After retreating to a hut the shepherd was joined by another servant, and they shot and killed 12 Aboriginal people (although it seems unlikely that 2 men could kill so many Aboriginal people in one operation).  The incident was clarified fifty years later. On 25 August 1877, the <i>Maitland Mercury</i> recorded that, 'a man who was present, as he admits, when a party had formed for the purpose of punishing the blacks for pulling cobs of maize in the field, and carrying it off in their nets to their camps. Observing some smoke rising from the midst of the Wallalong Brush, they armed themselves with muskets, and reached unobserved to the camp, where a considerable number of men, women and children were. They fired at once upon them, killing some and wounding others. The rest fled through the bush, pursued by the whites, and then the whole of the natives took to the water intervening between the brush and the high land, towards which it gradually deepened, and some of the poor creatures drowned.  My informant, now a very old man, while expressing regret as to occurrence, said the worst part of the whole all was, they afterwards discovered, that not one of those who were ""wanted"" was among them.'

One of the requirements of the licence of occupation of  Crown lands was to leave water sources for the Ngiyampa people as it was a particularly dry spell. Establishing the new station breached these instructions. The Ngiyampa retaliated by killing Robert Roach, William Moreton and Abraham Fearnham 'and wounded three others' (<i>SMH</i>, August 24, 1842, p 2). A detachment of Mounted Police based at Bathurst led by Corporal Reilly and assisted by squatter Joseph Moulder, William Carr (stockman on squatter William Lee's run at the Bogan River), Andrew Kerr and other stockmen, avenged the death of the three men, killing 12 Ngiyampa and arresting three of the alleged killers, one of whom escaped 'and two were committed to take their trials' [later released]  (<i>SMH</i>, August 24, 1842, p 2).  CLC William Allman investigated the case and charged the two Ngiyampa men with murder, brought them before the Circuit Court in March 1842, and secured their discharge for lack of evidence. Allman recommended that Lee's pastoral lease be withdrawn and not renewed, and Governor Gipps agreed. Outraged that a settler of Lee's standing should be treated in this way, a group of settlers at Bathurst petitioned Gipps to restore Lee's licence. The matter was raised by James Macarthur in the NSW Legislative Council on 22 August 1842 and in the debate on 23 August, Gipps justified his decision on the grounds that Lee had failed to observe instructions not to squat on the Bogan river and to leave water for the Ngiyampa.

360,td0d1e,1336,"Mount Foster, Wellington Pastoral District",Site,"A letter from Mr W.H. Wright to Colonial Secretary Thomson, 15th January, 1846 describes a large gathering of 150 to 200 men with women and children, from lands between the Macquarie, Darling and Lachlan Rivers (Wailwan, Wongaibon and Wiradjuri people). Following this gathering a war party of 40 warriors raided 5 stations, using Maliyanga Ngurra as a defensive position (Macquarie Marshes) until Native Police and local colonists pursued them and shot 10.
<br>
W.H. Wright wrote,
'These generally known as ""Myall"" or wild Blacks are joined at certain periods by large parties of Aborigines frequenting the country westward of the settled portions as far as the Darling River, when as many as one hundred and fifty or two hundred men are sometimes assembled besides Women and Children...
I regret to have to report that during the past Year the ""Myall"" Tribes or those of the unsettled portions of the District have committed many outrages on the persons and property of the Settlers on the Macquarie River, and have evinced a boldness and determination which I believe to have been unprecedented amonst Aborigines.
...
<br> 
From the time (Octr., 1844) that the Gerawhey Blacks drove 
Mr. Kinghorne's Superintendent and men from his Station in the 
flood which then covered the Country, Aborigines of that Tribe 
have been constantly threatening and actually committing depredations 
on the Settlers, and Warrants for the apprehension of eight 
individuals of that Tribe were issued. But, although fully aware 
of the fact and its intention, from the secure retreat they possessed 
among the Macquarie Marshes and being generally informed of 
the approach of any policemen, they only become bolder, and, in 
September last, had assembled to the number of about forty men 
at a Station near Mount Foster, which they had stated their 
determination to plunder as soon as the dray which had brought the 
Supplies and its attendants should return. 
<br>
At this juncture, a party of Mounted Police under Sergeant 
Anderson who had information of their intention came upon them; 
and, as most of the individuals named in the Warrants (which he 
held) were identified amongst the Tribe, he endeavoured to capture 
them, but being attacked and one of his party wounded he 
was compelled to fire. It is to be lamented that as many as ten 
Natives were shot in this encounter with the Police. At the same 
time I am convinced that, but for the appearance of the Police at 
this time and the Check given to the Aborigines, they would have 
pillaged many of the lower Stations and in all probability have 
murdered some of the Inhabitants.

Immediately before this a body of Blacks assembled from the Bogan, 
Lachlan, and country between the McQuarie and Darling Rivers, and among 
them I regret to say several of the Aborigines looked upon as domesticated, 
in all one hundred and fifty or two hundred men.

303,td0cc4,1336,"Murdering Island, Narrandera",Site,"According to an article in the Labor Daily, 1 Jan 1926, p 8, the death of Mr Jeremiah Rodgers was noted. 'He was one of the first residents in this [Narrandera] district, having been brought here with his brother Henry, 73 years ago [1853]. His father took charge of Brewarrina Station, and he managed the holding for 26 years... The pastoralists at that time experienced trouble from the blacks, who used to spear the cattle. So troublesome were they that the whites determined to deal with them in a summary manner. The whites drove the natives on to an island below Buckingbong and wrought such havoc in their ranks that the Island is even now known as ""Murdering Island""' (<i>Labor Daily</i>, 1 Jan 1926, p 8).
<br>
The name 'Murdering Island' was mentioned in 1873 (<i>Wagga Wagga Express and Murrumbidgee District Advertiser</i>, 5 November 1873, p 2). An article in 1895 gave the following account of how the place got its name: 'From the top of the hill also can be faintly discerned, what is described in Boldrewood's novel as the ""Murdering Lake,"" but which is known as the Murdering Island, on which were massacred some thirty-five years ago about 300 blacks. There are said to be two sides to the story. Some say that the only crime the blacks had been guilty of was that of stealing cattle. But certain it is that neither gins nor picanninies were spared. All were murdered on this island, and their bones, I am told, were lying bleaching there for years till a flood washed them away. It is said that an old blackfellow, named Mungo, escaped by diving under the water. I went a long way to have an interview with this old warrior, and found him partly drunk; but when I told him what I required his black eyes flashed beneath his white shaggy eyebrows as he grunted out the ghastly details, which, however, were of so spasmodic a nature that I could not glean much from his ravings. ""Yes,"" he said, ""white fellow kill blackfellow, gin, picaninny. What you do white fellow kill another white fellow? — you put him in gaol — white fellow kill black fellow, no matter — black fellow no account""' (<i>Freeman's Journal</i>, 5 January 1895, p 17).
<br>
In 1935 the Daily Advertiser reported, 'Another old Narandera identity, Mungo, was fond of describing his escape from death at the time of the massacre of the ""Murdering Island,"" when the settlers rounded up a great number on this little mud island in mid stream, and from either bank shot them down till very few escaped. One of these latter was Mungo, then a boy. He escaped by securing a long hollow reed and holding it in his mouth to breathe through when he dropped under water, as was frequently done by the blacks in catching wild ducks. He lay below the surface for hours till all the firing was over, and must have had a terrible experience. Mungo, in describing his escape from all the bullets that flew about, used to touch various parts of his head and body, saying: ""Yes, t'choota me here, t'choota me there, t'choota me every plurry where, and by cri' never touch me""' (<i>Daily Advertiser</i>, 27 May 1935, p3).",-34.788,146.614,1854-01-01,1854-12-31,"<i>Labor Daily</i>, January 1, 1926, p 8 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/239865993"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/239865993</a>; Wagga Wagga Express and Murrumbidgee District Advertiser, 5 November 1873, p 2 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article145058073"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article145058073</a>; <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, 5 January 1895, p 17 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article111108623"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article111108623</a>; Daily Advertiser, 27 May 1935, p3 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/144557491"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/144557491</a>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1073,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,1073,Wiradjuri,NSW,NSW,Goulburn,1854,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,70,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,"Settler(s), Stockmen/Drover(s)",Horse,Reprisal,Musket(s),*,,,,,,,10,0,0,Inland Rivers,South ,Inland Rivers: South ,East,South
113,td6290,1336,Warraweena,Site,"<p>The Maryborough Chronicle republished an extract from Stockwhip, 22 April, 1876 describing 'barbarities' committed in New South Wales in relation to the lethal flogging of an Aboriginal boy in Queensland. The article describes an atrocity in graphic detail, and mentions three locations at which 'barbarities' occurred in the vicinity of Brewarrina: 'When, however, these monsters ""had their cattle together"" they would collect themselves for the purpose of ""a bit of sport,"" which meant going on the trail of the aboriginals. ""Hospital Creek,"" opposite Breewarrina, ""The Point,"" between Yambegoona and the same place, and Warraweena Billywung might, if they could speak, tell of deeds unparalleled even in the Book of Books. We are now speaking of the years from 1840-1858' (Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 9 May 1876, p 4).<br>Hospital Creek is a well known massacre site. The incident at 'The Point' near Yambegoona is probably not a massacre, but the atrocity committed against an individual that is mentioned specifically in relation to 'Yambecoona' in another article: 'The most brutal story he told me, and again showed the spot and stump, was that he and two stockmen were coming up the river close to Yambecoona, when they met a blackfellow...' (The Kiama Independent, and Shoalhaven Advertiser, 1 Apr 1869, p 4).<br>This earlier article describes the activities of three Aboriginal men from Liverpool Plains employed by colonists in the area: 'One of these demons, Pelica Jemmy, told me some revolting stories. He said he had shot and poisoned in his time 170, and that Brewarina Jemmy, had killed far more than he' (The Kiama Independent, and Shoalhaven Advertiser, 1 Apr 1869, p 4). The article then focuses on Hospital Creek. The article makes it clear that the killing had been sustained for a long period at many sites but only mentions three specific sites: Hospital Creek, which is marked elsewhere on this site; Yambecoona at which one person was killed, and; Warraweena, the only other identified place where this widespread killing occurred.</p>",-29.935,146.234,1858-01-01,1858-12-31,"<p>Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 9 May 1876, p 4 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/148509158"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/148509158</a>; The Kiama Independent, and Shoalhaven Advertiser, 1 Apr 1869, p 4 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/113830392"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/113830392</a></p>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1120,2024-11-17 15:37:11,2024-12-23 12:53:38,1120,barranbinya,NSW,NSW,,,,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,20,,Colonists,0,,,Unknown,,*,,,,,,,73,32,7,Inland Rivers,Mid,Inland Rivers: Mid,East,South

362,td0d28,1336,"Hospital Creek, Brewarinna",Site,"After Aboriginal people speared cattle at Quantambone Station, Con Bride requested help from a neighbouring station (<i>Sydney Mail</i>, 12 Sep 1928, p 55). Con Bride with a group of about 20 heavily armed men including Mr J. McKenzie and Aboriginal assistants, Pelica Jemmy and Brewarinna Jemmy, attacked a camp of Aboriginal people at dawn, at a creek just north of Baiame's Ngunnhu (Brewarrina fish traps). Survivors fled in the direction of Culgoa River. Later sources say that around 300 people were killed and only a few escaped, including Peter Flood who died in 1911 (<i>The Farmer and Settler</i>, 24 October 1911, p 5). The creek was named 'Hospital Creek' after an Aboriginal woman was seen trying to care for wounded at this site (<i>The Kiama Independent and Shoalhaven Advertiser</i>, 1 April, 1869, p 4). 
<br>
The fish traps attracted visitors from far afield and the massacre may have involved Ngemba, Ngaampaa, Paakandji, Morawari, Budjiti, Barranbinya, Muruwari, Kooma, Kamilaroi or Wailwan people in this area. Colonists believed they had killed people of the 'Culgoa Tribe'. The Culgoa area is the lands and waters of Murrawarri people. In 1871, the population of the area was reported to have declined rapidly from thousands to 'only a few' over 20 years, 'Hence the name of ""Fishery"" at one time, about twenty years ago, this was the chief encampment for the blacks in the Western districts, for hundreds of miles around, and hence they were then to be found in thousands, but latterly there are only a few degenerate ones to be seen, the servile drudges of the (often) tyrannical white masters' (<i>Freeman's Journal</i>, 24 June 1871, p 11). In 1914 the Hospital Creek massacre was described as 'Among the worst massacres in New South Wales' adding that 'a party was got together, who surrounded about 300 aborigines at the creek, and shot down most of them, including women and piccaninnies' (<i>The Richmond River Express and Casino Kyogle Advertiser</i>, 31 July, 1914, p 8).
<br>
In 1928 an 'Old-timer' of the region, G.M. Smith, published an account of the massacre that he had heard when he was younger, from one of its leaders. According to Con Bride, Aboriginal people had been spearing cattle. 'I tried to get the blacks to shift camp, but they didn't understand me, or pretended not to which was very likely, as I could speak the native lingo pretty well. So I rode to the station as quickly as possible and brought one of my black boys to talk to them in their own lingo. When he explained what I wanted them to do they said ""Baal,"" which in their language means ""No."" They evidently didn't want to shift, as they were doing too well where they were; but I went back home and started one of my white stockmen up to the next station with a few lines to the manager to send me all the assistance he could spare in men, arms, and ammunition. The demand was only reasonable in those days, as the white settlers had to keep plenty of arms and ammunition for self-protection and to assist each other in cases of need. Next day I was pleased to see two white stockmen and half-a-dozen black boys, all well armed, ride up. You may be sure I lost no time in getting all my own force under arms, and we rode out to the blacks' camp nearly twenty strong. When we got within two hundred yards of the camp I halted my small force. Then I took one of the boys and rode up to their camp. When the boy told them I wanted them to shift the old darkies got very angry, and said ""Baal,"" as before. I took the boy back to the others, and said: ""Now, boys, we will fire a few shots over their camp. They might take fright and clear out."" That volley caused a great commotion in the camp. They all ran up in a bunch, like a lot of wild ducks; but there was no stampede such as we were expecting. I noticed that they were all arming with spears and womeras, and when they made a move forward I feared a rush on our small force by their hundreds: so we fired a volley into them, and a dozen or more fell. This caused a halt. Then they gathered round the wounded ones. Apparently they could not understand what had happened, and we took advantage of the confusion to send another volley whistling over their heads. That settled the matter. A general stampede took place across the plain towards the Culgoa, whence, I suppose, they had come' (<i>Sydney Mail</i>, 12 Sep 1928, p 55).
<br>
Perhaps the earliest account of the massacre is an article in 1869 republished from the Dubbo Dispatch, which reported, 'The blacks could be found in thousands on the Bogan River not twenty-five years ago; but where are they now? Can you find them in hundreds? No, nor in tens; and what you will ask, has become of them? Some have gone back into the Mulgar, and disease has done its work with them; but what has done the most deadly, work has been the rifle, not in every instance in the hands of the white man, but in the hands of their own fellow countrymen. There were at Brewarina and a station close by three blackfellows, natives of Liverpool Plains, that had been taught the use of firearms to perfection, and ditto the use of horses. These fellows for many years shot down everything black in human shape indiscriminately, wherever they met them. One of these demons, Pelica Jemmy, told me some revolting stories. He said he had shot and poisoned in his time 170, and that Brewarina Jemmy, had killed far more than he. He related an affray that took place in a back creek, not more than five miles from Brewarina; and in proof of his assertion showed me some hundreds of bones (I should say, the remains of forty). He, it appeared from his story, had been out on the run, and had tracked a lot of cattle away from the camp.; he further discovered that these cattle had been disturbed by the arrival of a lot of blacks to fish at this camp. He did not allow himself to be seen, but rode home, from whence an express messenger was despatched to Merriman, and some half-dozen other stations up the river, for all hands to come down to a blackfellows' hunt. All hands, were ready - whites and their Namoi demons - and started at night, arriving close to the camp of blacks before day, when they waited till daylight, then taking up positions so as to command the entire camp, they sent in a deadly volley, and in a short time there was not a black left. Some two days after four of the same party of murderers were riding by this said spot, when they found three blackfellows that had not died, and an old gin less wounded attending to their wants. ""Eloh?"" said one of the party, ""here's a hospital."" They got down and despatched the whole lot with a tomahawk, not caring to waste powder and shot on them; from that day till this this camp is called ""the Hospital""' (<i>The Kiama Independent and Shoalhaven Advertiser</i>, 1 April, 1869, p 4).
<br>
An 1876 article presents an extract from a document beginning, 'We are speaking (says the writer) of the year 1859.' and described some atrocities committed in the area adding, 'When, however, these monsters ""had their cattle together"" they would collect themselves for the purpose of ""a bit of sport"" which meant going on the trail of the aboriginals. ""Hospital Creek,"" opposite Breewarrina, ""The Point,"" between Yambegoona and the same place, and Warraweena Billywung might, if they could speak, tell of deeds unparalleled even in the Book of Books' (<i>Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser</i>, 9 May 1876, p 4).
 <br>
In 1911 the death of Peter Flood, an Aboriginal man who had survived the massacre was reported with additional details of the massacre, 'The blackfellow, Peter Flood, who died at Brewarrina, N.S.W., recently from pneumonia, was a full-blooded aboriginal, and was eighty-two years, of age. He was one of the survivors of the famous Hospital Creek massacre, which occurred fifty-two years ago. The blacks had been very troublesome and annoyed the station people to such a degree that it was decided to teach them a lesson. The white settlers, led by Mr. J. McKenzie, assembled, and proceeded in search of the aboriginals, whom they found to the number of about 300 encamped on the banks of Hospital Creek, which is situated about eleven miles from Brewarrina. An engagement took place, and only one or two aboriginals escaped. This particular tribe was known as the Culgoa tribe, and for many years had been a menace to settlers along the Culgoa River, spearing cattle and sheep, and stealing on every possible occasion. Peter Flood was one of the tribe' (<i>The Farmer and Settler</i>, 24 October 1911, p 5).
<br>
The reports consistently say that 300 people were killed at Hospital Creek, if a number is stated. 
Large amounts of people would have been congregated to feast at the fish traps. All accounts of the massacre involve a large force of heavily armed and mounted colonists gathered for the purpose of attacking Aboriginal people. The location is a vast treeless plain with no places of concealment. It is likely an unusually large number of people were killed.",-29.846,146.942,1870-01-01,1870-12-31,"Dargin 1976, p 59;

107,td6288,1336,Coolullah,Site,"In August 1883 Native Police Officers Frederick Clerk and Alfred Smart killed Kalkadoon people camped on the Coolulla Run after hearing a rumour that two prospectors had been killed (Marr, 2023 pp 356-357). The prospectors were later found to be alive.
<br>
Mr Ernest Henry telegraphed from Cloncurry that he had not reported that the two prospectors were killed, and that 'the only tragedy he has lately heard of in that neighbourhood was perpetrated by the native police' (Queenslander, 27 Oct 1883, p 669).
<br>
The following year a correspondent calling themself 'Drover' gave a full account of the incident:
'On 4th August last year I was camped on the Leichardt River, a little above the junction of it and the Cabbage Tree Creek.
About half a mile higher up, on the opposite side of the river, on a high bank, were camped 28 or 30 natives (men, women and children). The previous day I was on the Dougal River, when, at Granada run, I heard a report that two white prospectors had been killed by the natives, but my informant (who was a very old resident there) told me the reports were so conflicting he did not believe them, but thought that they referred to the killing of Beresford seven or eight months previous. About two hours before sunset on the day I write of, a sub-inspector of police (native mounted police) accompanied by a body of police, rode up and asked me where the blacks were camped, as he heard I was a good deal in the ranges. 
I told him of their exact position, as the paper tree obstructed the position of their camp from where we were. Being an old Crown officer, I took it for granted the police were going to secure the head men amongst them, which, with the force the sub-inspector had under command, he could easily have done; and I suggested a division of the men, and I showed him a plan by which he might take the lot; but no, that was not the course to suit the sub-inspector, so, under cover of a bend in the river, they crossed, full gallop, and straight at the unfortunates they went. The moment the natives saw them they jumped up from their camp fires and plunged into the large water hole they were camped on. 
The police surrounded the hole and shot every one of them except four women and I think four children. After the battle was over the women were divided as follows:— one to a stockman who came up, one taken to a man on the Dougal, one claimed by the police, and the fourth, being old and ugly, after being knocked down by the sub-inspector of police with the butt of his rifle, was sent with the children into the ranges to fare the best way they could. The police then came over the river, and camped for the night near me. 
Next morning they went off (as the sub-inspector informed me), to inquire into the reported killing of the two whites. So ended the earthly career of these unfortunate blacks, dying, they know not what for, and dying with a most damning opinion of the white men. I denounced the conduct of the police as I do now denounce the Government that allows such wholesale murders to be committed by its officers; and further allow me to inform you that the two men, who were reported to be killed, are now prospecting in the McKinlay Ranges, at least they were so when I left, well knowing the Gulf district, viz., Sam the Tracker and Cooper' (The Leader, 30 August 1884, p 35).",-19.956,140.12,1883-08-01,1883-08-31,"Marr, 2023; Queenslander, 27 Oct 1883, p 669 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19794259"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19794259</a>; The Leader, 30 August 1884, p 35 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197967524"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197967524</a>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1107,2024-11-17 15:37:11,2024-11-17 15:37:11,1107,,QLD,QLD,,,,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,20,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Native Police,Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),**,,,,,,,37,21,7,Kalkadoon and Selwyn Ranges,Kalkadoon,Kalkadoon and Selwyn Ranges: Kalkadoon,Centre,North

They trapped a group in a gorge on Battle Creek on Calton Hills station and shot and killed at least 18 of them. It is not known whether they were men or included women and children (Bottoms, 2013, pp 164-165).
<br>
On August 21st 1884, Sub Inspector F. Urquhart reported to the Commissioner of Police that after receiving news of the murder of J.W. Powell on the 21st of July, '... on the 22nd I left with 6 troopers and 13 horses ...' The group also included 'Mr A. Kennedy the late Mr Powell's partner...' and a 'wounded blackboy who had escaped from Mr Powells camp when the attack was made' After locating Powell's body 'On the morning of the thirthieth 30th I [Urquhart] started on the tracks of the blacks and as they had driven the horses and cattle with them it was very easy  easy to follow their trail although the country traversed was mountainous and extremely rough. We passed through ten 10 camps in all of which cattle had been killed and in some cases yards made to hold them - after travelling twenty miles we dropped into a deep gorge in Gunpowder Creek [near Battle Creek] and there detected the smoke of a camp fire curling upwards - An hour before sundown I had my troopers in ambush round the camp which was a very large one there being apparently upwards of one hundred and fifty blacks in it Trooper Billy acting on my orders summoned them to surrender in their own language but they resisted and as further hesitation would have involved the escape of the offenders and possibly the destruction of my little party I gave the order to fire and thirty 30 of the blacks were shot. Trooper Larry was knocked down by a black but beyond this I have no casualties to report - Many blacks escaped but my detachment was not strong enough to admit of my doing more...' 
He added that, 'Between the scene of the murder and the head of the [Wills?] I broke up and dispersed four 4 more large mobs of blacks one of which I was informed by the gins had been watching Mulligans prospecting camp on the Leichardt for some days with a view to making an attack upon it and as they were within a mile of that camp when I came upon them...  I think the blacks have had a caution which will exercise a deterrent effect upon them for some time to come' (QSA COL A/49714 ITM665853 pp4-9)

<br>
According to Richards' research, a detachment of six Native Police led by Sub Inspector Frederick Urquhart and assisted by settler Alexander Kennedy set out to avenge the killing of 'a Chinese shepherd on Granada station 70kms north of Cloncurry.' They encountered 150 Kalkadoon warriors on a hill and called on them to surrender. There was an affray in which 'an unknown number of men, women and children were killed.' None of the attacking party was wounded (Richards, cited in Bottoms, 2013, p 166). Urquhart's report is in <i>Urquhart to Ahern</i>, 15 March 1885. QSA A/41765. ID 290473.
<br>
In 1965 Wittington summarised that after the massacre at Battle Gorge which was a response to the killing of Powell, 'The Kalkadoons were, however, by no means subdued. Soon afterwards, at a lonely outpost on Granada Station, they raided and burnt the camp and killed the Chinese shepherd. Urquhart, with Hopkins, the owner, and a strong force of Native Police, tracked the Kalkadoons to Prospector's Creek, some 60 miles north-west of Cloncurry.
In one of the few recorded pitched battles between whites and aborigines, the Kalkadoons fought to the bitter end. Most of their warriors were wiped out in repeated charges against the rifles of the firmly established police force.' (Wittington, 1965 p519)
<br>
This conflict was mentioned in 1900 in the Brisbane Courier, 'In their day the Kalkadoons formed the most warlike and desperate of the tribes that the early pioneers had to contend with. They occupied the mountain ranges, and knowing all the country round, terrorised the blacks of the lowlands, always making good their escape to their mountain fastnesses. At
Battle Mountain they kept a certain police
inspector at bay for the greater part of the
day. One of the survivors of the encounter
is ""Tabby,"" still on Glenroy, and still wears
a bullet wound on his head.' (<i>Brisbane Courier</i>, 13/10/1900, p 6)
<br>

181,td0d2b,1336,"Spear Gully, Halls Creek",Site,"In June 1886, Halls Creek gold miner Fred Marriot was speared to death by Jaru or Kija people. Police reports attributed the killing to Aboriginal aggression although the reason for this attack was the miner's abduction of an Aboriginal woman and keeping of her for sexual purposes. Other oral history accounts state that the miner gave Aboriginal people poisoned flour (Kimberley Languages Resource Centre 1996, p 37). In July 1886, a group of Halls Creek prospectors organised a punitive expedition and as Robert Tennant Stow Wolfe, a member of the party, stated: 'We all went out and dispersed those niggers' (Clement 2000, p 6; Clement & Bridge 1991, p xiii). Aboriginal oral history accounts and private accounts of this incident differ from the official statistics in the numbers of Aboriginal people shot. In 'Moola Bulla: in the shadow of the mountain', the authors draw from oral accounts and suggest 'as many as 100 Jaru or Kija killed in reprisal for the killing of Merriott [sic] a miner' (Kimberley Languages Resource Centre 1996, p 37). Then there is the private diary of a young prospector, George Hales, who wrote that: 'A number of diggers went out to take revenge. Having bailed up a large number of blacks in a gully who showed fight, they proceeded to slaughter them with repeating rifles. It is certain that a great many were killed, some say at least a hundred' (Hales cited in Green, 1995, p 59).",-18.2,127.509,1886-07-01,1886-09-01,"Clement, 2000, p 6; Clement and Bridge, 1991, p xiii; Kimberley Languages Resource Centre (eds), 1996 <i>Moola Bulla: In the shadow of the mountain</i>, Magabala Books, Broome, p 37; WAPD, Report by Sergt Troy from R.

John Durack was fatally speared. Colonists across the Kimberley including Michael Durack, Sergeant George Trusclove, PC Strickland a man called Kelly, Special Constable Reen, an unnamed Native Assistant, and a party of unnamed men that numbered twenty in all, formed a punitive expedition. Official reports declared that only two men were killed. Later reports from solicitor Richard Septimus Haynes described, in a letter to <i>The West Australian</i>: '...when 100 or 150 natives were slaughtered in cold blood, happened within the last six years, some little distance inland from Derby, and was related to me by an eye-witness' (<i>The West Australian</i>, November 14, 1892, p 3).

According to Aboriginal oral history via Jack 'Banggaiyerri' Sullivan as told to Bruce Shaw: 'When they started forming the stations, Johnnie Durack would ride around from the old station with a pack, round and round to find the good places. One day he was in the lead while another fella drove his pack, and he put down to where he was going to cross a creek. That was where he ran into the blackfellers. Instead of frightening them away he straightaway pulled out a gun – bang bang bang bang – and chased one feller down to the creek. The blackfeller ducked around and as Johnnie passed him, looking out for him, of course he let drive from the side and got him. When his mate found out he was speared he just galloped away leaving the pack horses there. If he had let the blackfellers go it would not have happened, but they all had the bloody wind up' (Shaw, 1983, p 68).",-15.502,128.346,1886-11-17,1887-01-11,"WAPD, East Kimberley Wyndham Police Station.

After rumours circulated that a lot more people were killed, more evidence came out. There were five more colonists including a man called Howard and another called Liddelton with the police party and they had all agreed to launch a punitive expedition to 'teach them a lesson' for spearing colonists' horses. Police officer Richard Troy charged all the men with murder which caused outrage in the town of Wyndham and there were fears the townspeople would try and break the accused out of prison. Though charged, none were convicted due to 'lack of evidence.' When Howard was confronted with the charge of 'murdering five natives', he told police that he thought the killings might have 'blown over', remarking that 'I cannot see that I have done much wrong' (CSO, 'Government Resident Wyndham - Natives (5) shot by PC. Graham & others in April 88). It is pos­sible that over sixteen times more Aboriginal people (including women and children) were killed than the ones mentioned.

403,td0d33,1336,Goldfields Road - Halls Creek,Site,"In July 1888 George Barnett was speared and killed by Jaru/Kija people while travelling between Fletcher Creek and Halls Creek. In reprisal, a punitive expedition was launched which resulted in 'a massacre that is regarded as one of the most sweeping in local history' (Durack, 1936, pp 35-36). The massacre was widely publicised throughout the district with the editor of <i>Northern Territory Times</i> (voicing public opinion) writing that the police should disregard any laws, and 'simply admonish them and disperse them in the Queensland fashion' implying to shoot them all (<i>Northern Territory Times</i>, August 18, 1888 p 3). The <i>Eastern Districts Chronicle</i> posited that the punitive expedition: 'travelled over 700 miles [1127 kilometres]. The party found and dispersed over 600 adult male natives and a number of females and children' (<i>Eastern Districts Chronicle</i>, October  13, 1888,  p 2). The 1929 memoirs of August Lucanus, a special constable (and former German soldier and former South Australian Mounted Constable) in the punitive expedition, stated only that 'there must have been at least 200 blacks, and they had not even tried to obliterate their tracks, we soon overtook them and they put up a fight, the women howling and sooling the men on to us. We dispersed them at last, and returned to Wyndham' (Clement & Bridge 1991, p 46). Mary Durack added that 'Barnett's brother cut a triangular notch in the stock of his rifle for every native he shot with it...and the notches numbered thirty-five!' (Durack, 1936, p 35).  Colonel Angelo, the government resident of Roebourne at the time, later wrote of this incident:  'accounts differ as to what actually happened but it is almost certain that from sixty to seventy natives there and then paid the extreme penalty.

Thomas depicted this on the right of the painting, one of the few figurative elements in any of his works. The stockmen left the station in protest and, without labour, it was forced to close. This incident was part of the pattern of frontier violence in the region, from when settlers arrived in the East Kimberley in the 1880s in pursuit of gold and pastoral land, through to the 1930s. Aboriginal people were denied access to their country, as well as food and water resources. Killing cattle was a strategy to repel the invaders, as well as a food source. Such resistance from Aboriginal people was met with shocking violence, euphemistically described as 'dispersal'.

In retaliation police recorded shooting twenty-three Mirriwong people in this ambush although the actual figure may have been higher (<i>The Daily News</i>, September 27, 1893, p 2). The publicised killing of this many Aboriginal people sparked an outcry in Perth in which the Catholic Bishop of Perth [Bishop Mathew Gibney] publicly denounced the killing of Aboriginal people in the Kimberley: 'In the affair on the Behm [sic] River, therefore, the troopers had the game in their own hands. And on their own showing, brutally did they use their advantage. It is not credible for a moment that the natives obstinately stood their ground and threw futile spears until the whole twenty-three had fallen... it is perfectly clear that in this case the choice was not given them. Some were slain fighting; but some, at least certainly ran, and were not these followed up and deliberately shot down as they ran? This was hardly so much a fight as a battue a massacre.…The story of their accusers we have heard but their defence we shall never hear' (<i>The Western Australian Record</i>, October 5, 1893, p 7-8).

As they followed the tracks they discovered more dead cattle and two dead horses. They came upon the camp in the morning and Collins was speared in the stomach.

It comprised Sergeant Brophy, PCs Rhatigan, McCarthy and Lucanus, and native assistants Rocket, Willie, Mickey and Dickey. Over nearly two months from 1 October to 24 November 1893 they travelled 1091 kilometres and, as their reports indicate, shot thirty Aboriginal people (SROWA, AN 24, Cons. 527, File 90/1894). This patrol consisted of incidents such as this: On 14 October 1893 Sgt Brophy who was in charge of a police patrol reported killing four men and catching 'a few old men and women who could not run away' and instructed his native assistant to tell them that if they kept killing cattle or breaking insulators on the telegraph line 'all the natives would either be shot or put in gaol'. The following day the police patrol came across another group along the Ord River and because he 'could plainly see that the natives intend to fight it out', six more who he wrote were 'notorious cattle killers' were killed. On 19 October four more were killed. On 23 October 1893 the patrol discovered a group camped whom Brophy described as 'the most treacherous in the district'. Each officer took thirty rounds of ammunition and they waited until daybreak to raid the camp. In the dawn raid the 'women and children ran away' but all the men took to the rock hideaway with spears. Brophy wrote: 'It was not until 10 were shot dead that they made any attempt to run away.

Willshire, writing in 1896 (pp 40-41), said: 'In the month of June, 1894, we came across some tracks of natives that had been recently killing cattle on the Victoria Run…They scattered in all directions, setting fire to the grass on each side of us, throwing occasional spears, and yelling at us. It's no use mincing matters — the Martini-Henry carbines at this critical moment were talking English in the silent majesty of those great eternal rocks. The mountain was swathed in a regal robe of fiery grandeur, and its ominous roar was close upon us. The weird, awful beauty of the scene held us spellbound for a few seconds'.

The following May (after the Kimberley wet season when police could travel again) they attempted to arrest Nalmurchie again. They camped near Goose Hill but only managed to arrest 27 men who had no involvement in the crime. Neville Green (1995, p 95) suggests that many had been killed here but no record was made. On 13 June 1899 Farley (with five Native Assistants) and PC Evans again attempted to arrest Nalmurche though it is clear Farley (illegally) sent his assistants to arrest or shoot Nalmurchie. Farley recorded (though he was clearly not there) that the Assistants raided a camp of 100 people and though they fired shots made no arrests.

In September 1911, Sergeant R.H. Pilmer led a police punitive expedition to find the culprits and ensure the stock route remained open. The police made no arrests, but the expedition was considered a success after Pilmer acknowledged killing at least 10 Aboriginal people. Later newspaper reports, (<i>Daily News</i>, May 21, 1912, p 8) put the figure at 14. Pilmer wrote in his diary:  'The most exciting and disastrous incident of the whole journey happened on 16 November while the party was spelling the camels at Well 46. The men were whiling away their time by reading or doing odd jobs when they were suddenly attacked by a band of 25 Aborigines. Fourteen Aborigines formed an advance party, and each armed with two whackaburras they came running down a gravelly slope towards the camp. Going outside the camp Sergeant Pilmer called and motioned them to sit down, but they still came on, it being evident they were trying to get close quarters with the police. The invaders reached the camp but were not close enough to use their weapons when the police opened fire. Six natives fell dead while another was killed about twenty yards away. Three were wounded but they escaped with the others who immediately took to their heels' (Pilmer cited in Clement, 1989b, pp 130-151).",-20.641,126.287,1912-01-06,1913-04-11,"'Shooting Aborigines', <i>Daily News</i>, May 21,  1912, p 8 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/79898128/7816557"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/79898128/7816557</a>; Clement 1989b, pp.130-151;

410,td0d4f,1336,Mowla Bluff - West Kimberley,Site,"Recorded in multiple Kimberley Aboriginal oral history accounts, colonist Georgie Wye [Why] was assaulted by Mowla Bluff Station workers for killing an Aboriginal man and mistreating Aboriginal women (Watson, 2012, pp 51-60). Wye was notorious for shooting Aboriginal men to take their wives. A reprisal followed where Georgie Wye, George Lovell, George Layman, Jack Tighe, PC Jury and various police launched a punitive expedition. The subsequent massacre occurred at Geegully Creek where anywhere between ten and a larger number of Karajarri, Mangala and Nyikina people were caught, chained together, forced to collect wood, shot and then incinerated. Elder John Darraga Watson recounts how the punitive party tracked a large group and 'sneaked into the camp and fired shots to frighten the people…They rounded up these people and chained them together.' They were told to 'get wood' under the pretense that they would be fed on a 'killer' [cattle killed for stockmen's and stockwomen's consumption]. Nobody suspected anything was amiss.' So they got the wood together, piled it up, lit the fires and then got the people together again. Then they started shooting them and when they were dead, chucked them on the fire. Any woman, any little kid, they whacked them on the back of the head and chucked them on the fire, burned them up, lot of people got burnt.' The remains were then destroyed. Watson says he was told that 300 or 400 were killed and only three escaped (Marshall 1988, p 226). 
Eye witness accounts recorded in Witness statements taken by police at the investigation confirm these accounts. Nullagumba Moon describes how the punitive party of men opened fire on the chained men 'emptying their magazines.' He stated 'After the shooting stopped I saw all the bodies lying in a heap.' They then unchained them. Then George Lovell went and cut some wood. First they made a heap of small sticks and put a lot of large wood on top of it. Then they placed the 6 bodies on top of it and put more wood on top of the bodies. 'The heap of wood was higher than my body' Nullagumba Moon stated. 'Jury lighted the fire. We all stayed there until the fire was burnt out. When it was quite burned down they raked up all the ashes, bones and pieces of unburnt wood together. We then left it and came back to the camp to have dinner.' (SROWA, AN 5/1, Cons 430, Item 1919/1812).",-18.706,123.693,1916-09-01,1916-09-30,"'Alleged shooting of Natives at Gee Gully...'

He was employed at the station and was camped near the creek in order to fix fences. He was found with two spear wounds in his back and one in his left arm. The Aboriginals accused were pursued into the stone country of Razorback Mountain (now known as Razorback Hill) on the West Baines River by Mounted Constable O'Connor and a party comprised of Archie Skuthorp (Manager, Auvergne Station), George Campbell, Bobby Frank and Peter (Aboriginal tracker). Three Aboriginal men were shot and killed on Razorback Mountain – names recorded as Milderong, Wilpelum and Warook and one was wounded – on 29 March. On 2 April, another four were found dead in the water in a gorge after the party opened fire following an ambush. They were identified as Doorakborough, Youburen (alleged to have speared MacDonald), Wungarrie and Yomgurrior. The wounded man was Lingerry and all belonged to the Cuderong tribe. What became of Lingerry (ie whether he survived) is not known. The Aboriginal attack was led by Youburen, according to Frank, an Aboriginal man. 

Lewis (2021, p 25) corroborated this and questions the report of Mounted Constable O'Connor in relation to the difficulty of the pursuit. ""At the very least it appears that O'Connor exaggerated his report to make his patrol seem much more dangerous than it really was.

47,td0d53,1336,"Sturt Creek, East Kimberley",Site,"According to oral testimonies passed down within dozens of local families, and backed up by handwritten diaries of the time, a police party toured the area on horseback in October 1922 searching for an Aboriginal man named Banjo, who was thought to have murdered pastoralists Joseph Condren and Tim O'Sullivan as O'Sullivan had taken his wife, Topsy. In the first subsequent massacre at Kaningarra, between Wells 48 and 49 on the Canning Stock Route, a police punitive expedition came across an encampment where Aboriginal people were cooking camel meat, and kept shooting into the encampment until they ran short of ammunition. Those who survived were led off and tethered by neck-chains to a site called the 'Goat Yard' at Denison Downs. The second massacre soon after, took place at the former Denison Downs homestead on the Sturt Creek Station, in a site referred to as Chuall Pool, where many Djaru, together with Walmajarri, were slaughtered. The victims were the survivors of the Kaningarra massacre (Smith, 2016, p 124). Subsequent archaeological evidence has provided proof of incineration of human bones at this site. Grant Ngabidi recalls the first incident: 'Four Halls Creek Policemen and three other white men came out. Someone told them who the two blackfellas were and they went low down looking among the bush people.' They told them, 'Oh big mob there, longa billabong, longa Wolf junction', and they sneaked up. There may have been about twenty or thirty police boys too.

198,td0d56,1336,Forrest River [Oombulgurri] -  East Kimberley,Site,"Allegations of a massacre at Forrest River or Oombulgurri in the North Kimberley in 1926 were made by Reverend Ernest Gribble. These allegations generated such sensational national reporting that it led to the <i>Royal Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Killing and Burning of Bodies of Aborigines in East Kimberley and into Police Methods when Effecting Arrests</i> chaired by George Tuthill Wood (Wood, 1927). The 'Forrest River massacre', in reality a series of massacres, was sparked when in May 1926, Lumbia speared a stockman of Nulla Nulla Station, Fred Hay, allegedly because Hay had raped one of Lumbia's wives. In mid-1926, in the wake of the killing, two police parties consisting of 13 men – Leopold Rupert Overheu (part-owner of Nulla Nulla Station with Hay), Daniel Murnane (a veterinary surgeon), two special constables (Bernard Patrick O'Leary, a pastoralist from Gallway Valley Station, and Richard John Jolly), seven armed native assistants and forty-two horses led by PCs Dennis Regan and James St Jack – went on a six-week pursuit of Lumbia. The party had between 400 and 500 rounds of ammunition and each man carried a 0.44 Winchester rifle. During the expedition through late June and early July, Aboriginal people were shot and burned. Estimates of the number killed vary widely. In 1968, the brother of Overheu told historian Neville Green that his brother had admitted to killing 300 people though this figure is unlikely and is in dispute (Green 1995, p 206). In the subsequent Royal Commission Inspector Douglas himself was 'satisfied' and gave evidence that 'sixteen natives were burned in three lots: one, six and nine' (<i>The Daily News</i>, May 5, 1927, p 2). Commissioner Wood reduced this figure and found that eleven people had been murdered and their remains burnt (Owen, 2016, pp 439-444).",-15.2,127.85,1926-06-20,1926-07-31,"Wood, 1927 <a href=""https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/catalogue_resources/93281.pdf"">https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/catalogue_resources/93281.pdf</a>; <i>Daily News</i>, July 8, 1926, p 4 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/84162412/8406726"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/84162412/8406726</a>; <i>Sunday Times</i>, March 13, 1927, p 18 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/58325091/4346136"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/58325091/4346136</a>; <i>The Advertiser</i>, July 16, 1928, p 13 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/49398848/2483931"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/49398848/2483931</a>; <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, March 8, 1927, p 11 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/16359964/1209517"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/16359964/1209517</a>;  <i>Brisbane Courier</i>, March 9, 1927, p 15 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/21121887/1643178"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/21121887/1643178</a>; <i>The Mullewa Mail</i>, September 9, 1926, p 2 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/240326539/26067489"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/240326539/26067489</a>; <i>The Daily News</i>, May 5, 1927, p 2. <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78743784"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78743784</a>; Shaw, 1981, pp 157-163; Green, 1995, p 206; Auty, 2004, pp 122-155; Owen, 2016, pp 439-444.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=918,2024-06-01 00:06:21,2024-11-17 15:29:54,918,Yiiji,WA,WA,Wyndham - East Kimberley,June/July 1926,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,11,,Colonists,0,"Settler(s), Police, Aboriginal Assistant(s)",Horse,Reprisal,Winchester(s),***,Reprisal for the spearing of a colonist accused of raping Aboriginal women.,11- 50,,,,,99,5,3,Kimberley East,Late,Kimberley East: Late,North West,Late
281,td0c89,1336,Christmas Creek 'Wangkatjungka',Site,"In January 1930 witnesses had come forward saying that in late 1927 Albert 'Bert' Smith and Jim Robinson had caught, shot and incinerated seven Aboriginal men on Christmas Creek Pastoral station in the Kimberley (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). Smith was the station manager at Christmas Creek Pastoral Station (260 miles inland from Derby). Smith, a notoriously violent man, and Robinson visited an Aboriginal camp a few kilometres from his homestead and took captive six Aboriginal people (and neck chained them), their names being Comet, Jagabadger aka Jacaticia, Lalvert, Bagga, Maanda and Jolgoo. On that night after being marched eight miles they were chained to the fork of a tree so high up they had to stand all night on toes (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). The next day – after a 10 mile trek - they were again chained high up to trees. Comet was subsequently let go but the other five were never heard of again (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). Three days later Smith and Robinson did the same thing with two named 'Nyella aka Skinny' and 'Cheetan' (who were chained to a verandah post of the blacksmiths). They went out with them on the chain and returned to their station without them (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). Newspaper reports suggested the missing men 'slipped off the face of the earth. They simply vanished' (<i>The Truth</i>, January 19, 1930, p 1). Depositions taken from workers on Christmas Creek through a very thorough investigation by Detective Bert Flanagan tell a different story. The men had allegedly been spearing cattle on the station, so Smith and Robinson murdered them (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). Detective Flanagan interviewed 15 Aboriginal witnesses who all asserted the same story. Bert Smith (armed with a revolver and rifle) caught five men then another two chained them to a fork in the tree for two nights with the chain so high they could not sit down. One witness said 'they choke' (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). Then the Aboriginal wives were ordered to collect light wood while Smith and Robinson collected large logs. One witness was ordered to fill flour bags with charcoal and tins with kerosene. Every witness said 'I saw them go out I never saw them come back I think they finished' (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). Another witness could trace the Aboriginal tracks to a burn site but there were no tracks out. 'We been then looking for whitefellow track and see the track of toe and heel and boots been standing on grass close to where the fire had been.' 'I been hearing long time before this Bert Smith been shoot em boys before…' one said (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929). Police had enough evidence to charge him, not for murder as no bodies could be found, but for eight counts of assault. However, when the case went to court, on 25 March 1930, there was only one charge that was heard - the abuse of one man, Comet. Smith had no legal representation, simply denied everything and had five white witnesses who testified they had never seen anything untoward at the station. The jury deliberated for 10 minutes and returned a 'not guilty' verdict. The Crown prosecution subsequently withdrew the other seven charges of assault and Smith walked free (SROWA WAPD, Acc 4431/1929).",-18.875,125.92,1927-12-01,1927-12-10,"'Alleged shooting of Natives by Bert Smith at Derby,' WAPD, Acc 4431/1929, SROWA; Bohemia and McGregor, 1992, pp 26-40; <i>Truth</i>, January 19, 1930, p 1 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/210493943/22684256"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/210493943/22684256</a>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1036,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,1036,Nyikena,WA,WA,West Kimberley,12/1927,Evening,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,7,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Stockmen/Drover(s),Horse,Opportunity,"Revolver(s), Winchester(s)",***,,men,Wangkatjungka,,,,11,5,3,Bunuba and Kimberley West,Late,Kimberley West: Late,North West,Late
315,td0db1,1336,"Risdon Cove, River Derwent",Site,"About 11am on 3 May 1804, a large group of Big River/Oyster Bay men, women and children suddenly appeared on top of a hill on a kangaroo drive near the recently established British colonial outpost at Risdon, on the eastern shore of the River Derwent.  According to witness Edward White, 'they did not know there was a white man in the country' and they 'looked at me with all their eyes' (BPP 1831, p.53).  Lt William Moore, the officer in charge at the outpost, ordered two detachments comprising eight soldiers from the garrison, 102nd Regiment (NSW Corps) to fire at the Big River/Oyster Bay people in two separate engagements in which at least two Big River/Oyster Bay warriors were killed. Then in a third engagement, the magistrate at Risdon Cove, surgeon Jacob Mountgarret, ordered that a twelve-pounder carronade be dragged up the hill from the water's edge and loaded with grape and canister shot and fired at the Big River/Oyster Bay people to disperse them. The sound of the carronade was heard at Hobart on the other side of the River Derwent at 2pm. Mountgarret then led a group of armed men comprising at least 12 soldiers,  ten convicts and two  settlers, in a charge 'some distance up the valley' where 'more were wounded' and 'a fine Native boy' about two years old was captured after his 'Mother and Father were both killed' (Watson, (ed.) 1925, HRA, III, i, 237-8). Three British witnesses recorded their experiences of the massacre.  Two of them were the leading perpetrators,  Moore and Mountgarret, who each provided written reports in the immediate aftermath.  Mountgarret claimed that 600 Aboriginal warriors threatened the outpost by attacking a settler and that only two Aboriginal men were killed, although the official report, prepared by Lt Governor David Collins on 15 May 1804, said that 'at least three' were killed (Nicholls 1977, p 51; Watson ed (1925) HRA III, i, pp. 237-8). The third witness, Edward White, a convict in 1804, was interviewed about the incident at an official inquiry, known as the Broughton Committee, 26 years later in March 1830 and provided the first coherent account of the massacre. He said that the soldiers began firing at 11am and that 'a great many' Oyster Bay/Big River people were 'slaughtered and wounded' and in the aftermath, surgeon Mountgarret, dispatched 2 casks of Tasmanian Aboriginal remains to Sydney (BPP 1831, 53-4). At the Broughton inquiry, the Reverend Robert Knopwood, said that he visited the Risdon outpost a week after the 'affray' and supposed that 'five or six' Tasmanian Aboriginal people were killed  (BPP 1831, p53). However, the harbour master James Kelly told the Committee that '40 or 50' were killed (BPP 1831, p.51).  John Pascoe Fawkner,  later said  in his 'Reminiscences' that 'not less than fifty were shot down' (Fawkner 2007, p.24).
Historian James Bonwick,  investigated the 'affray' in the 1850s and noted that Dr Mountgarret sent two casks of Aboriginal remains to Sydney and they may have been the remains of the six bodies observed by Knopwood. Bonwick was also told by Moore's commanding officer, Captain A F Kemp, that Moore 'saw double that morning from an overdose of rations rum'  and 'the whole was the effect of a half-drunken spree, and that the firing arose from a brutal desire to see the Niggers run'  (Bonwick 1870, p35).  Bonwick was the first to publicly call the 'affray' a 'massacre' and was in no doubt that the soldiers of the 102nd Regiment (the NSW Corps) were responsible for the  'barbarous onslaught upon the Natives at Risdon' (Bonwick 1870, p36). 
The claim by genocide scholars in the early 21st century that the Risdon massacre was the beginning of the genocide of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, attracted a host of deniers whose purpose was to undermine Edward White as a reliable witness. Keith Windschuttle(2002) and W F Refshauge (2016) each used an out of date map of Risdon Cove to claim that Edward White could not have witnessed the massacre from where he said he was standing. Windschuttle also said that Bonwick could not have interviewed a settler of 1804 because no one who was present was still alive when  Bonwick conducted his alleged interview; and that there is no evidence that  2 barrels of Tasmanian Aboriginal remains were shipped to Sydney (Windschuttle 2002, pp 11-28; Refshauge 2016). The claims were ably refuted by  Phillip Tardif (2003).  In 2022, Scott Seymour, George Brown and Roger Karge in their book, 'Truth-Telling at Risdon Cove', claimed that  Edward White could not have been a witness to the massacre because, according to the records, he was not in Tasmania at the time (Seymour, Brown and Karge 2022). Tardif rejected their claims in 2023.  He considers that White's  'detailed, accurate and consistent testimony, the acceptance by settlers and officials that he was a Risdon pioneer, and the clear statement made (in 1833) by long-term Hobart resident John Fawkner that he had known White for almost thirty years (i.e. since 1804), make for a strong case in his favour.' (Tardif 2023, p.27).
<br>
In 1833, in response to Edward White's petition, endorsed by the Colonial Surgeon and other early settlers, the Colonial Secretary, John Burnett stated that ""Your Memorialist [Edward White] arrived in the Colony in the year 1803 being the first settlement of this Colony.""

While some details vary in individual accounts, the incident was a matter of common knowledge in the early colony. The massacre is mentioned in an article in the Hobart Town Gazette in 1826 in relation to widespread conflict, as being the first act to have ""...brought things to their present irremediable pass."" (Hobart Town Gazette, November 11, 1826, p 2)

In 1830 a public meeting was held to discuss a proposed war of extermination in relation to government proclamations, including Government Order No. 10 [Hobart Town Courier, September 25, 1830, p 1] which details what came to be known as 'The Black Line'. The discussion was opened by Mr Kemp who attributed the conflict to the killings at Risdon Cove:

""Mr. Kemp commented at some length upon the aggressions committed by the Blacks, which he attributed in a great degree to some officers of his own regiment, (the late 102d), who had, as he considered, most improperly fired a four pounder upon a body of them, which having done much mischief, they had since borne that attack in mind, and have retaliated upon the white people, whenever opportunity offered."" [Colonial Times, September 24, 1830, p 3] 
This was seconded by Mr Gellibrand who added: ""It has been stated by Mr. Kemp that we have been aggressors in the present unhappy state of hostility that prevails between the white people and the black Aborigines. This reflection cannot but give rise to the most painful feelings. How dreadful is it to contemplate that we are about to enter upon a war of extermination, for such I apprehend is the declared object of the present operations, and that in its progress we shall be compelled to destroy the innocent with the guilty.""

The capture was reported by magistrate at Sorell, James Gordon, to the Colonial Secretary in Hobart later that day and reported in the two Hobart newspapers a week later (Gordon to Col Sec, 10 December 1826, TAHO CSO 1/331, pp 194-195; CTTA, December 15, 1826; HTG, December 16, 1826).

A coverup had taken place. In March 1830, Chief District Constable Gilbert Robertson was the first to mention the massacre in evidence to the Aborigines Committee and stated that: 'The Richmond Police in 1827, killed fourteen of the natives, who had got upon a hill, and threw stones upon them. The police expended all their ammunition, and then charged with a bayonet.'

Two different accounts of reprisal killings appeared in the same issue of the <i>Colonial Times</i> (July 6, 1827, p 4). The first account stated that: 'The Military instantly pursued the blacks – brought home numerous trophies, such as spears, waddies, tomahawks, muskets, blankets – killed upwards of 30 dogs, and as the report says, nearly as many natives, but this is not a positive fact.' The second account stated that: 'The people over the second Western Tier have killed an immense quantity of blacks this last week, in consequence of their having murdered Mr Simpson's stockkeeper. They were surrounded whilst sitting around their fires when the soldiers and others fired at them about 30 yards distant. They report there must have been about 60 of them killed and wounded.' The official report of this incident however, said that 'between twenty and thirty of their dogs' were killed and one Aboriginal 'possibly wounded.' When  government agent, G.A.

James Simpson, the magistrate at Campbell Town, ordered a party of  soldiers from the 40th Regiment along with stock keepers and field police to pursue the culprits.

Historian Patrick Collins (2002, pp 96-101) considers that the massacre was an 'encounter of major proportions and that many Aborigines died, rather than the tiny number implied by Bennett in his affidavit', an encounter in which Aboriginal people were 'pursued through the scrub' (2002, p 97). Collins suggests the attack was in preparation for putting the station up for sale and to assure potential buyers that it was safe from Aboriginal attack (2002, pp 96-101).

According to Collins (2002, p 164),  on 20 April 1852 Dempster and his detachment of six native police were ordered by Lt George Fulford to visit William Ogilvie junior's Wachoo station where the 'blacks are killing and disturbing the cattle'. 'Should any collisions occur...with the hostile blacks you will use every endeavour upon your part to prevent the unnecessary effusion of blood and sacrifice for life' (Fulford in Collins 2002, pp 164-165).

Collins believes that an investigation was carried out into Dempster's behaviour and that he was suspended for three months but the affidavits and the report are missing from the archives. Collins considers that a witness to the Yamboucal massacre, George Neale, told of the massacre to explorer Hovenden Hely who was in the area at the time, conducting a search for the missing explorer, Leichhardt (Collins, 2002, pp 173-179).

355,td0d12,1336,Moonie River,Site,"In a lecture on 'The Kamilaroi Blacks' the Rev. William Ridley reported that on the 29th September, 1853 stockmen told him of a massacre of 19 Aboriginal people killed by the Native Police near Mr Pearce's station on Mooni Creek, now Mooni or Moonie River.
<br>
'At the Brothers [a pastoral station near the Barwon River] I heard the details of a lamentable and recent slaughter of blacks. Some stockmen who were driving a herd of cattle down from Mooni Creek to the Murrumbidgee, related that on coming to a station of Mr. Pearce's on Mooni Creek, they saw nineteen blackfellows ""doubled up,"" that is lying dead in the writhing attitude of their last agony. They had been killed the evening before by a party of black police and some white men belonging to the station. 
The stockmen who described the event, said that the wild blacks who were shot were coming down to attack the station; chiefly for the purpose of killing the blacks who had settled there; so that the charge which laid them prostrate was a necessary act in defence of those blacks who had a claim on the protection of their employers. It is quite true that the wild blacks often entertain bitter enmity against those of their race who have become somewhat civilised by association with the whites; just as among our own forefathers, when the savage Danes found their kindred tribes the Angles and Saxons bereft of their ferocity by the influence of Christianity, they hated them with intense hatred for their softness. 
But in this case I afterwards heard, on better authority, that the wild blacks had made no attempt on the station, or on the lives of the blacks connected with it; that the only plea for this act of butchery was that they had been spearing cattle, and it was surmised that they meant to attack the station; so the police and their instigators, having tracked them to a spot near the station, came unawares upon them, and poured their death volley into the midst of them. 
Even those who sought to justify the deed by the plea of necessity, spoke with such undisguised gratification of the result, as to show plainly that they welcomed it as a gain instead of enduring it as a dire necessity. The murderous spirit-no other epithet would correctly describe it-the murderous spirit in which not a few rejoice at the frequent slaughter and anticipated extinction of the blacks is appalling. If, while the brutalized and ferocious delight in such deeds, and resolve to repeat them, those who have still the feelings of men keep silence on the subject and so wrap it up, will not the Lord, the Righteous Judge of all, make inquisition for blood, and be avenged on a nation where such crimes are winked at?' (Empire, 3 Dec 1853 p 3).
<br>
A much earlier article in the Morning Chronicle indicates that Mr Pearce's station on the Moonie River was 'Gnoolamata', north of the intersection of the Moonie and Barwon Rivers (Morning Chronicle, 4 Fed 1846, p 2). This is most likely the same run as is marked on a map of pastoral runs as 'Cholamatta' just over the Queensland border (Reuss & Browne, 1860).
<br>
While the Rev. Ridley, wrote the massacre was 'recent' in September 1853, Patrick Collins, a historian of the Maranoa District frontier, speculates that this occurred in 1852 and was carried out by Sergeant Dempster leading a contingent of Native Police from Wandai Gumbal. According to Collins, this could explain why Aboriginal people from the Moonie River had travelled east to carry out attacks south of the Callandoon Native Police Barracks, around Carbuckey Station and Boobera Lagoon (Collins, 2002, pp 198-199).",-28.934,148.738,1852-09-20,1853-09-29,"Empire, 3 Dec 1853 p 3 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/60146903"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/60146903</a>;

Bligh, however, was unable to get Jonathan and Margaret Young to openly  identify  four of the killers that he arrested following their identification by one of the Young's Aboriginal workers.  Bligh charged the four men with murder and sent them to Maitland for trial at the District Court on 12 February 1849.  When Bligh sent the papers for the case to the Attorney General in Sydney, he was told that unless the Youngs were prepared to openly identify the killers, a conviction was unlikely. So the case did not proceed and the four stockmen held in custody at Maitland were released.

The original information came from a shearer on the Murray, who, according to Assistant Protector Parker, ""stated in a neighbouring wool shed that a Mr Beveridge had 'settled' the blacks by leaving a quantity of poisoned flour in their way, and that numbers had been killed by it""' (Parker cited in Cannon 1990, p 231). 'Parker despatched some of his Station blacks to the junction of the Loddon and Murray to ""make enquiries"". They returned with almost identical information from blacks on Edward Curr's and Archibald Campbell's runs: ""they were informed that seven or eight natives had been destroyed""' (Cannon, 1990, p 230).
'The story fitted fairly precisely with rumours heard by Dr James Horsburgh at Goulburn River Aboriginal Station. …Parker was commissioned to obtain further evidence if he could. In February 1849 he was told by natives from Lake Bael Bael that ""a number of the blacks of Tarrkgoondeet tribe [the 'reed-spear tribe' of the lower Murray] have been poisoned some months since by white men at a place called Bapparrinok""' (Parker cited in Cannon, 1990, p 230-231). When La Trobe pressed for more 'information to the Bench of Magistrates at Moulamein, north-east of Swan Hill, on the Sydney side of the Murray River, Patrick Brougham JP, replied that he ""certainly some months ago heard a report of the same [alleged poisoning], but took no notice of it, as groundless rumours have frequently been spread of natives having been killed""'(Brougham cited in Cannon, 1990, p 231).",-35.221,143.559,1848-06-01,1848-06-30,"Cannon, 1990, pp 230-231.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=553,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,553,Wemba Wemba or Wadi Wadi,PPD,VIC,Murray,June 1848,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,20,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Settler(s),Horse,Opportunity,Poison,**,,,,,,,10,0,0,Murray River,Late,Murray River: Late,South East,South
174,td0d1b,1336,Swan Valley,Site,"In 1914 a local historian, 'C.B' described an increase in conflict in 1831, during which sheep were driven off from the farms of Mr Brown and Mr Bull. 'The opening months of the year 1831 passed without any serious outbreak, but in September and October there was a recrudescence of the depredations. At this period The Most Serious Raid chronicled up to then took place on the stock at the Upper Swan. Nearly 100 sheep were looted from the locations of Messrs. Brown and Bull, and a strong party of natives being detected in the act. The natives were driven off, but not before half of the captured stock had been killed and eaten' (Western Mail, 16 Jan 1914, p 53). C.B. says that no aboriginal people were killed in these reprisals, but earlier sources indicate a massacre or massacres occurred in the aftermath.
<br>
Early colonist Captain Charles Fremantle wrote of an incident in the Swan Valley after over 40 of Peter Brown's sheep were taken by local Noongar people in what they clearly considered an act of reciprocity and exchange of food. Local Noongar approached the farm shouting 'Kangaroo, Kangaroo!' suggesting exchange of sheep for the kangaroo the colonists had killed (Fremantle cited in Carter, p 78). 
<br>
Another account by Jane Dodd provides more detail about the reprisal. Lilian Heal in her book on the colonist Jane Dodds (1788-1844) quotes from a letter written by Dodds which was extracted in The Morning Herald (London), 4 September 1832:
<br>
'Tom sends you a kangaroo skin, two spears and one throwing board, the latter the natives never part with but with life. You have, no doubt, heard bad accounts of them, but in almost every instance the settlers have been the aggressors; the one I am about to record you may rely on is true. A party of natives drove off several of Mr Browne's sheep, in sight of the shepherd, calling ""Kangaroo, kangaroo"", which was a plain way of saying ""you have killed our kangaroo, now we must have yours"", but the sequel is dreadful to contemplate; they were followed, and the soldiers and others fell in with them about midnight (it was supposed their number exceeded two hundred men, women, and children), seated around several large fires, at which were roasting about ten sheep; the followers all fired into the midst of the thickest groups, killing some, and wounding many; however, the others fled in the greatest confusion, leaving all they possessed behind them, and among the rest the spears in question. In the course of a day or two some of the natives returned, and murdered the shepherd, which created no small sensation in our neighbourhood, but it appears they will have a victim should any of their party fall, and they always aim at the quarter from whence the blow comes upon them, so that the innocent often suffer with the guilty' (Heal, 1998, p 60).
<br>
George Fletcher Moore wrote of the sheep raid at Mr Bull's but did not indicate that Aboriginal people were killed: 'Proceeding upwards in a due north course, we passed a fine reach of perhaps a mile and a half in length, having some very rich ground on its banks, which seemed so admirably adapted for a farm, that we gave it the name of ""Homestead Reach."" A little above this we crossed the river, finding the way almost impracticable for our horses, from the stony nature of the ground. From this, proceeding still due north, we passed a dry rocky broad part of the bed of the river, which was recognised as the spot to which nearly 80 sheep of Mr. Bull's were formerly driven by the natives, and on which many of them were slaughtered' (Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, 27 May 1834, p 4).
<br>
In 1833 Baron Von Huegel wrote that the raid of Mr Bull's sheep lead to the killing of Aboriginal people: 'For instance, Mr [Henry] Bull, the settler at the furthest reach of the Swan River, lost a flock of 70 sheep. This attack, however, had grave consequence for the savages. A detachment of troops pursued them as they carried off their booty. They finally drove them into a valley surrounded by cliffs and fired at them at will until they cried out for mercy' (von Hügel, 1994, p 28).
<br>
It's unclear whether there was a single massacre after the two raids, or whether the sequence of events was the first raid at Mr Brown's, a first reprisal massacre at a large campsite at Swan Hill, the killing of a shepherd in retaliation, the second raid at Mr Bull's followed by another massacre in a narrow stretch of river at Success Hill.",-31.895,115.958,1829-01-01,1829-12-31,"Western Mail, 16 Jan 1914, p 53 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/44881496"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/44881496</a>; Berryman, 2002, p 233;  Carter, 2005, pp 78-80; Heal 1988; Blight 2024 <a href=""https://maryblight.com/2024/02/25/massacres-on-noongar-boodjar-from-1830-onwards/"">https://maryblight.com/2024/02/25/massacres-on-noongar-boodjar-from-1830-onwards/</a>; Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, 27 May 1834, p 4 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2216240"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2216240</a>;

175,td0d1d,1336,"Galup, Lake Monger",Site,"On the 3rd of May, the commandant of the Swan River Colony's 63rd regiment Frederick Irwin received a message 'soliciting Aid against the Natives on the Part of Inhabitants of the West End of the Town' (Irwin to Stirling, CO 18/7 p 119). The message included a description of raids and a violent encounter between three soldiers and Nyungar people who had occupied the house of a man named Paton. Later newspaper reports summarise the increasing tension and violence in the region at that time (<i>Western Mail</i>, 9 January, 1914, p 38 and 20 March, 1914, p 52). At Paton's house, when colonists tried to drive the Noongar people away, spears were thrown and a man who 'appeared the Chief, shewed unequivocal Gestures of Defiance and Contempt. On the Muskets being presented, the People now fired, and this Man was seen to fall wounded, falling a second time after rising. The Natives now made a rapid Retreat, leading him off' (Irwin to Stirling, CO 18/7 p 119). Ensign Dale and some guards went there ahead of Irwin and more men.
<br>
Irwin wrote in his report to Lieut. Governor Stirling: 'This daring and hostile Conduct of the Natives induced me to seize the Opportunity to make them sensible of our Superiority, by shewing how severely we could retaliate their Aggression, but that we had no Wish to injure them. With this View I continued the Pursuit, directing a Shot should not be fired but in Self-defence' (Irwin to Stirling, CO 18/7 p 119).
<br>
Two groups of colonists, one led by Ensign Dale and the other by Irwin tracked a group of Noongar people to a Lagoon. Ensign Dale was injured with spear wounds and a Noongar warrior shot in the jaw. After a twenty minute 'parley' Ensign Dale's group opened fire. Irwin included the following details:
<br>
'While observing the Natives here, several Shots were fired towards us from the opposite Bank by Mr. Dale's Party. On calling out for an Explanation, and to order the firing to cease, I learned that a Volley of Spears had been thrown at them while penetrating the Swamp to where the Natives were. Three Spears had pierced the Arm of the Acting Serjeant Major, and the Party fired in return. One of the Natives now called out from a Tree he had ascended, and gave us to understand that their Women and Children were with them, and seemed earnest in his Entreaties that we would leave them. I now told the Party to leave the Swamp, and for about Twenty Minutes we held a Parley; the Natives pressing us to leave them, and we in vain trying to encourage them to come out to us. At this Period, hearing a trampling in the Lagoon, I proceeded alone down the Bank, and distinctly heard the Groans of the wounded, whom they were carrying past; but the Height of the Reeds concealed them, except the Tops of their Spears. Considering the Object I had in view as now fully accomplished, of impressing a salutary Dread of our Superiority and Arms, while we shewed them we did not wish to injure them, after getting them and their Families completely in our Power, we left them, at Sunset, apparently on Terms as friendly as usual. 
<br>
'During the night nothing was heard of them, but next Morning they were seen to cross the River at the Islands, with their Families, in considerable Numbers.
<br>
'A Patrol I sent out for the Purpose brought in Three Natives they had surprised. These Men had been often seen in the Cantonment, and willingly accompanied the Soldiers. They intimated, by Signs, that some of their People were dead or wounded in the Lagoon, after Yesterday's Fire. When this was told me, I took them off to the Lagoon, but they could show none, and I concluded they meant only to signify that some of their people had fallen there.
<br>
'On our Return we observed a Body of about Forty, including Women and Children, moving Westerly; some came towards us, on being called; and with these and our Guides to the Swamp we parted on very good Terms'
(Irwin to Stirling, CO 18/7 p 119).

Irwin did not report the number of people killed.
A letter from W.H. Mackie to Colonial Secretary Brown summarised the initial confrontation at Paton's house in more detail, indicating that two Noongar men were shot there, prior to the pursuit to the swamp:
'...they however stood boldly on the defensive, and when a gun was pointed at them laughed in a scornful manner and made signs of defiance - upon this a shot, or as some say two or three, were fired at them. One man is stated to have fallen, but whether from fear or a wound has not been ascertained. The shots however were ineffectual, for the Natives immediately rushed forward with loud cries upon the settlers, who, amounting at that time to only three or four, ran back, followed by a volley of spears and were pursued as far as Minchins.' The Noongar people collected their spears and returned to the house. The colonists called on their neighbours who came with firearms. 'A charge of small shot was then fired, but without effect, at the nearest of the savages, who instantly rushed on to the attack as before, throwing their spears as they advanced; but the settlers, amounting by this time to more than twenty, advanced to meet them, firing as they advanced, (by which fire another of the savages is said to have fallen) when the latter suddently wheeled round, and ran off at full speed' (Mackie to Brown, 1830).
<br>
Mackie then described the pursuit to the swamp at which more were killed:
'At this moment the 
military who had been sent for by several of the settlers came up and joined in the pursuit 
which was continued to a swamp about two miles to the North West of the camp, into 
which the natives ran, and in which they were surrounded by the settlers and military by 
both of whom (although strict orders had been given to the latter not to fire 'till ordered) 
several short shots were fired and more than [note: ""more than"" is crossed out in the 
original text] one or two of the natives are said to have fallen. They were seen also to carry 
off some wounded or dead into the interior of the swamp and the moans of the wounded 
were distinctly heard' (Mackie to Brown, 1830).
<br>
An article on the incident published in London reported seven were killed: 'In such situations they were shot at with facility; but they feared not the thunder and lightning of the Europeans; and seven of their number were killed' (<i>The Literary Gazette and Journal of the Belles Lettres</i>, 11 December 1830, p.805).
<br>
Historian Dr Chris Owen and Dr Clint Bracknell, a Noongar man, note that Irwin 'had reason to downplay the violence and the extent of the killing. Governor Stirling had proclaimed Noongar people as British subjects and therefore subject in law to the same protections as white subjects' and that 'Fabricating and minimising the numbers of Aboriginal people killed would become a resonant theme throughout Western Australian history. This culture of suppression was echoed across the continent and was later lamented as a ""conspiracy of silence"" by a 1927 royal commission into the Forrest River massacre in the Kimberley' (Owen and Bracknell, 2021). Irwin's narrative points out that the shooting was conducted not by his group but by the detachment under Mr Dale, in a spot he could not see, and states that the Noongar people carried away their dead and wounded, meaning that they could not be counted. Owen and Bracknell state that in Noongar oral history there is a 'near-uniform insistence that ""a lot of Noongar were killed there""' (Owen and Bracknell, 2021).
<br>
John Morgan, WA Colonial Storekeeper to Under-Secretary for Colonies, recorded an estimate of at least 30 killed or wounded in a letter to Robert W Hay, dated 14 July 1830: 'The Natives, – have been very troublesome at Perth since I wrote, and in a skirmish with a strong party, who were evidently determined upon mischief, – several of the detachment 63rd Regt were wounded with spears, – and report says, – (for it was impossible to ascertain the fact) that thirty, or forty of the natives were kill'd or wounded' (Morgan to Hay, CO 18/7 pp.333-339; see also the summary in Buchanan and Buchanan, 2004 p 16).
<br>
Morgan's number of 30 or 40 killed or wounded differs greatly from other reports of how many were killed. The detailed reports of Irwin and Mackie make it clear that those killed could not be observed and so their numbers are indeterminate. Morgan's report may be biased against Irwin as they were in dispute over accounts related to the use or misuse of soldiers (Irwin to Stirling, 1830). This may equally be a reason to inflate the figures, as it may be to break the code of silence over how many were killed. Morgan was not present, but reported what he had heard. This could suggest either that his figure was exaggerated, or that he was reporting the 'off the record' numbers he'd heard from others.",-31.929,115.826,1830-05-03,1830-05-05,"Irwin to Stirling, CO 18/7 p 119 <a href=""https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-2030475659/view"">https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-2030475659/view</a>;

110,td628c,1336,York (1),Site,"A letter by the amateur ethnographer Robert Lyon (also known as Robert Lyon Milne) to the Colonial Secretary, Lord Goderich, protests at an attack on Nyungar people at York in 1832. Lyon wrote, 'The local government seem to have returned to the intelligent principle of governing the native tribes without a knowledge of their language - or rather have determined to let the settlement take the chance of an interminable war. No proclamation appeared; & since the above was written, one of the chiefs a man who by his example & his influence has saved more lives and property than all His Majesty's forces in Western Australia - has been dangerously wounded by some white savage. Notwithstanding this, I have succeeded, under divine providence in effecting a cessation of hostilities. So soon as I came from Carnac I went into the bush alone unarmed & met Yellow Gongo [Yellagonga] chief, a King of Mooro, whose district comprehends Perth & the country to the north of the Swan. He gave me assurances of peace & friendship, & presented me with a womera & a spear. Since then they have refrained even from molesting the stock. How long this calm may continue, God only knows. The settlers & soldiers at York have committed a horrible action: They went at night to an encampment of the natives &, while they were sitting round their fires poured the shot among them - men, women & children. Their cries were dreadful' (Lyon, 1832, p151).

Armstrong and the pair could converse sufficiently to come to an explanation that the Noongar people 'wished to come to an amicable treaty with us, and were desirous to know whether the white people would shoot any more of their black people. Being assured that the white people would not, they proceeded to give the names of all the black men of the tribes in this immediate neighbourhood who had been killed [Names not included in article], with a description of the places where they were shot, and the persons who shot them.

399,td0d20,1336,Pinjarra,Site,"Captain James Stirling's plan to create a settlement south of Perth at Pinjarra was thwarted by the 'Murray tribe.' He told the Colonial Office in London that they threatened to destroy all the whites in the district and argued that if a 'check' was not made on them, they may 'tempt other tribes to pursue the same course, and eventually combine together for the extermination of the whites' (Owen, 2016, p 73).  The 'check' occurred on 28 October 1834 when Governor Stirling and twenty-four soldiers and civilians cornered the Murray Tribe' of some 'estimated eighty men, women and children in what has become one of the most infamous punitive expeditions in Western Australian history.' A large number of 'people were killed, the event itself created political controversy and, later, historians debated whether the 'check' was legal, 'just battle' or a 'massacre'. Stirling's own words on this matter were explicit and suggested the massacre description was apt. In his report to the Colonial Office, he declared that he had set out to punish the whole tribe and that his intention was to instill fear in the Aborigines and break their resistance. The only way to deal with Aboriginal people, he wrote, was to 'reduce their tribe to weakness' by inflicting 'such acts of decisive severity as will appall them as people'. The <i>Perth Gazette</i> reported on an uncompromising warning to the survivors that if there were any more trouble 'four times the present number of men would proceed amongst them and destroy every man woman and child' (Stirling, 1834, cited in Owen 2016, p 73). 
Stirling later wrote to British Colonial Secretary Stanley (1 Nov 1834). He stated he said this to the surviving prisoners: 'they were then informed that the punishment had been inflicted, because of the misconduct of the tribe, that the white men never forgot to punish murder, and that on this occasion the women and children had been spared, but that if any person should be killed by them, not one would be allowed to remain alive this side of the mountains. Upon this they were dismissed' (Stirling cited in Contos et al, 1998). The 'mountains' Stirling referred to are the Darling Scarp, a mountain range east of Perth that extends for over 400 km from Bindoon in the North to Pemberton in the South West. Stirling was effectively threatening to kill 80% of the Noongar population of the South West. Another account from Grose (1927) states 'The whites opened fire. About 80 blacks were killed and the bodies of many of the dead floated down the river. A bugle then blew to cease fire, after which the native women and children were gathered together and Sir James Stirling warned them that a similar punishment would come back to blacks in the future if any more whites were killed or molested. About 50 natives were buried in one great hole, which was afterwards located in Mr Oakley's field beside Captain Fawcett's property at Pinjarra Park' (Grose 1927, pp 30-34).",-32.63,115.871,1834-10-28,1834-10-28,"Owen, 2016; Stirling, CSO No 14 to Stanley, 1 November 1834, CO 18/14 f134; Grose, 1927; Green, 1981; Contos, 1998; Hunt, 1978; Harris, 2003; Green, 2003.

Conflict started between the Bussells and the Noongar Wardandi traditional owners and escalated over the next four years, as increasingly severe tactics were used to stop the Wardandi from visiting their farms. They shot at 'intruders', made a wooden cannon to fire at them and took hostages, on one occasion holding a 'little girl', and another four women and a child (Shann, 1978, pp 98, 106). On 23 June 1837, a calf went missing. Allegedly Gaywal and Kenny had speared it. In retaliation on 28 June 1837, Henry Chapman  and his brother, Alfred Bussell, an unnamed Corporal, a man named Moloney and Elijah Dawson went to Yulijoogarup and were involved in a massacre in which at least nine of the tribe were shot down.

27,td0cf6,1336,York (2),Site,"After the southwest Pinjarra massacre of October 1834 sites of conflict shifted northeast into Whadjuk and Ballardong Aboriginal Noongar country around Northam and York. From 1836 through 1837 tensions escalated with many reprisal killings between Aboriginal people and colonists. 
<br>
In 1836, the Sydney Herald reported 'by late arrival' that 'The natives in the York district had committed several outrages, and two were shot. Additional military aid, under the charge of Lieutenant Bunbury, was despatched to the settlement' (<i>Sydney Herald</i>, 13 Oct, 1836).
<br>
Lieut. Bunbury wrote, in a published letter dated, 10 July 1836
'A few days after my return I was ordered over here [York] with a detachment to make war upon the Natives, who have been very troublesome lately, robbing farms and committing other depredations, even attempting to spear White people. 
...I hope, however, it will not last very long as the Natives seem inclined to be quiet since I shot a few of them one night. I have no doubt, however, that ere long they will revenge the death of those we shot by spearing some White men when they can meet them alone and unarmed' (Bunbury, 1930, p 27)
<br>
In June 1837 a group speared and killed Isaac Green, a soldier (<i>Perth Gazette</i>, July 22, 1837, p 941). 
<br>
A letter to the Swan River Guardian alluded to this being a retaliation for attacks on Aboriginal men and women,
'If the Natives have committed it wantonly, they ought to be severely punished. If on the other hand, their wives have been shot at in cool blood, and many of the males killed in a vindictive manner, then, the Natives have only obeyed one of their immutable Laws, which demands blood for blood'
(<i>Swan River Guardian</i>, 1 Jun 1837, p 128).
<br>
On 8 July 1837 Edward Jones and Peter Chidlow were working on a property called Katrine when a large group of up to 40 Ballardong Noongar, incensed by the arrest of some of their countrymen for stealing, approached them demanding flour and bread. A fight broke out and both Jones and Chidlow were speared to death (nine and seven spears respectively) in an event creating months of payback conflict (Perth Gazette, 22 July, 1837 p 941). 
<br>
These killings prompted calls from colonists for reprisals: 
'To the Government Resident of York, D. MacLeod, Esq., and Lieutenants Bunbury and Mortimer, of H.M.'s 21st Regt., the difficult task of conciliating or coercing the natives has been confided... The barbarous murder of Jones and Chidlow has called for a severe and well-merited chastisement; the lives of three natives have fallen a sacrifice ... we therefore unhesitatingly, in common with the majority of our fellow colonists, give our full approbation of the proceedings of the government, being strongly impressed with the conviction, that nothing short of a bold and daring display of our superiority of which the distant tribes hold some doubt, construing our acts of kindness into timidity or imbecility will effectually eradicate from the mind of the savage, the impression that we may be plundered and murdered with impunity' (Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 29 Jul 1837, p 944). This article also lists the names of Aboriginal people accused of murder and livestock stealing livestock.
<br>
On 20 July 1837 a writer in the Swan River Guardian commented, 'Some parties advocate an indiscriminate slaughter of the Blacks, in the York district, others transportation of the Natives, from the Main Land, to one of the neighbouring Islands...Unnecessary cruelty ought not to be inflicted, but the deaths of Chidlow and Jones must be avenged, and we say that ample justice ought to be dealt against their Murderers in the first place, as a terror to their assistants or abettors, and in the next place let us enquire what salutary measures can be adopted to civilize the Natives, and make them acquainted with our Laws, our Religious, Civil and Military Institutions, and their own rights as British Subjects. A general Massacre would be offensive to the Laws of God, as well as those of Man, because the innocent might then be sacrificed to atone for the crimes of the guilty... The Murder of Chidlow and Jones calls aloud for vengeance, but Justice should be tempered with mercy, indiscriminate slaughter of inoffending Tribes can never be palliated' (Swan River Guardian, July 20, 1837 pp 205-206).
<br>
Another article warned, '... for so long as the British Government withhold protection and assistance from this Colony, a continual warfare will exist between the whites and blacks' and 'let us never forget that a general warfare must end in an utter extermination of one or other of the contending powers...' (Swan River Guardian, 20 July, 1837).
<br>
In November 1837 Reverend Louis Giustiniani wrote a series of letters to the Swan River Guardian saying in one that 'The huts of the Natives have been wantonly fired into during the night by Mr McLeod, and his assistants and the Kangaroo Cloaks of the poor creatures tossed into the fire' (Swan River Guardian, 16 November, 1837, p 248), and elsewhere that, 'The death of Jones and
Chidlow has required <i>eighteen</i> innocent victims, (that is the complaint of the Aboriginal British Subjects). They have been immolated to the vengeance of a party in the most cruel manner. Every Soldier had received a <i>carte blanc</i> from Lieutenant Bunbury and Mr Mc Leod, to <i>shoot the Natives in all directions</i>, and they have been faithful to their mission; but none of those victims had been previously tried, nor even the least evidence brought against them, before the deadly weapon of the armed European prostrated them to the ground. Barbarities of the middle age have been committed even by boys and Servants, who shot the unarmed woman, the unoffensive child, and the men who kindly showed it them the road in the bush; the <i>ears of the corpses have been cut off</i>, and hung up in the kitchen of a gentleman, as a <i>signal of triumph</i>!' (Swan River Guardian, 16 November, 1837, p 249).
<br>
Violence continued after this massacre. In May 1839 Sarah Cook and her infant child were killed at York by Nyungar people and there were attacks on Aboriginal groups subsequently (Green 1984 p 214). An attack by a posse in June 1839 reportedly resulted in one dead and two wounded and there was an attack on the York Encampment in July 1839 by a posse in which three were reported as wounded (Green 1984, p 214). Green cites 'C. S. O. 1839, Bland, 26 August' for the first and 'C. S. O. 1839, 74 Bland, 31 July' for the second. The link between the killings of Sarah Cook and her child and the June-July attacks, and the ideas that the attacks were on Ballardong people, and were organised by Lieutenant Mcleod, Government Resident at York, come from Mary Blight (Blight 2024) rather than from Green.

400,td0d23,1336,Wonnerup 'Minninup',Site,"The events leading to the massacre(s) began early in February, 1841. Some Noongars were employed in threshing wheat on the farm of Molloy's neighbour John Layman, and some Noongar women were employed in the house. A dispute arose over payment (in damper) and Noongar man Gayware approached Layman. Layman grabbed Gayware by the beard and shook him, Gayware speared him and Layman struggled inside and died. On 6 February 1841 Magistrate John Molloy and John Bussell raised a party of settlers and workers and 'soldiers', which pursued and surrounded the Noongars, killing seven, and then subsequently pursued a larger body of Noongar north towards Bunbury where many more were killed around 'Lake Mininup' (<i> Perth Gazette</i>, March 13 , 1841, p 3). (Wonnerup, Layman's property, is a few kilometres north of present-day Busselton and Minninup another 15 km or so up the coast.) In 1897 the historian Warren Bert Kimberly wrote up this event as a massacre which took place at Lake Minninup near Wonnerup as 'one of the most bloodthirsty deeds ever committed by Englishmen'...'Although several natives were killed the settlers and soldiers were not satisfied. They redoubled their energy, determined to wreak vengeance on the main body. They rode from district to district, from hill to hill, and searched the bush and thickets. At last they traced the terrified fugitives to Lake Mininup. Here and there a native was killed, and the others seeing that their hiding place was discovered fled before the determined force. They rushed to a sand patch beyond Lake Mininup. Colonel Molloy observed a boy forsaken by his parents. He rode up to him, and to save him took him on his saddle. The lad, whose name was Burnin, survived, and lived in the district until a short time ago. The soldiers and settlers pushed on, and surrounded the black men on the sand patch. There was now no escape for the fugitives, and their vacuous cries of terror mingled with the reports of the white men's guns. Native after native was shot, and the survivors, knowing that orders had been given not to shoot the women, crouched on their knees, covered their bodies with their bokas, and cried, ""Me yokah"" (woman). The white men had no mercy. The black men were killed by dozens, and their corpses lined the route of march of the avengers.

422,td0d8e,1336,"Skull Hole, Mistake Creek, Forsyth Ranges",Site,"The Norwegian naturalist Carl Lumholtz recorded in 1881 that he had been shown skulls of people killed in a massacre by Native Police:
'In the vicinity of Bledensbourne I was shown a large number of skulls of natives who had been shot by the black police in the following circumstances:—A couple of teams with provisions for the far west, conducted by two white men, had encamped near the blacks. The latter were lying in ambush, and meant to make an assault, as two black women had been ravished by the white men. Instead of defending themselves with their weapons, the white men were cowardly enough to take flight, leaving all their provisions, oxen, tent, and all their other things in the hands of the blacks. The fugitives reported to the police that they had been attacked, and so the ""criminals"" a few weeks afterwards were pursued far into a narrow valley and shot. I visited the spot in company with the manager of Bledensbourne station, and saw seven or eight of the skulls. According to the statement made by several persons, nearly the whole tribe was killed, as there was no opportunity of flight' (Lumholtz, 1881, pp 53-54).
Lumholtz had been en route west to Elderslie, before going to 'Bledensbourne'. As Elderslie is west of Winton, 'Bledensbourne' is most likely Bladensburg just south of Winton.
<br>
P.F.H. Mackay published an account of this massacre, told to him by Hazelton Brock in an article published in The Queenslander (20 April, 1901, pp 257-258). The story is as follows: 
<br>
In 1877, George Fraser was droving 700 cattle to a new stockrun he planned to establish at Bladensburg, about 15 kilometres south of present day Winton, in Western Queensland. He led a party of about eight stockmen, including Hazelton Brock and Jack Wilkinson, a man named Bill and two 'new chums'. After one of the 'new chums' was killed by a group of Guwa warriors, Fraser buried the body and sent another stockman for help at the native police camp at Blackall. When a detachment of native police, led by sub-inspector Robert Moran, arrived a week later, Fraser and his party had tracked the Guwa to a large camp site near a waterhole now known as Skull Creek and surrounded by steep cliffs at the head of Mistake Creek in the Forsyth Ranges. With the party now increased to 14 men, Fraser and Moran planned to attack the camp at dawn the following morning. The evening before the attack they tied up their horses more than a kilometre away from the campsite, climbed a hill above it and waited until dawn. With the sound of a mopoke as the signal, the 14 men surrounded the camp from above on three sides and began shooting. The Guwa scattered in all directions but most of them made for the waterhole. After many of them were shot, the native police went after the rest with their machetes and hacked many of them to death in the water. Hazelton Brock estimated that 200 Guwa were killed in the massacre. Brock 'collared' an Aboriginal boy from among the few survivors, named him Boomerang Jack and brought him up as a stockman. In 1901 he was working on Collingwood Station, 50 kilometres west of Winton. In the aftermath, Brock took squatter John Arthur Macartney to the site to get some 'bones and specimens'. 
<br>
Although Brock's account is told as a 'bush yarn' the specific details and correspondence with Lumholtz's description indicate the story is based on real events.

In 1889 a corresponden to the Daily Telegraph, 'J.W.C' wrote, 'White women were scarce in those days,
and these men took as help-mates a couple of
black gins from a tribe belonging to the head
quarters they started from. The aborigines or
native blacks were very troublesome in those
days, especially in the vicinity of Cape Hawke,
not far from the Manning River entrance, and
being aware that a supply of rations had been
recently brought to Gangat and that there were
only two men in charge, they decided to
stick the station up and help themselves,
One or two of the Cape Hawke blacks
were in the habit of visiting the station occasionally on their marauding excursions, and unwittingly, apparently, made the gins acquainted
with their designs, probably in the hope of
satisfying them of their safety in the event of
success. The gins were honest enough to
apprise their mates of the threatened danger,
and suitable precautions were adopted. Slits
were cut in the slab walls so that guns could
be protruded to cover the approach of their 
assailants. Everything useful and portable
was brought into the humpy and doors and
windows barricaded. On the morning of the
attack two blacks came to the hut as usual and
were at once ordered to leave and keep away or
they would be fired upon. The day wore on and
towards the afternoon a mob of blacks numbering from 50 to 60 came down to the station,
fully armed for hostilities with spears, boomerangs and nulla-nullas, and demanded grub.
These also were cautioned to keep off under
penalty of being fired upon, and seeing the
muzzles of two guns sticking out of a slit in a
slab in front of them, they retired a few yards
off, made their fires and camped for the night.
Their intention evidently was to attack the
station as soon as it was dark, and probably
set the hut on fire and murder the men.
Taylor and M'Grath were in a serious fix.
Miles from any help, their horses in the bush
unavailable for flight, they felt that with the
approach of night their doom was sealed, and to
make matters worse, on examination they
found that they had only a couple of charges of
powder. Taylor fortunately had a good supply
of arsenical soap, so the men went to work and
made up a lot of Johnny cakes, well mixing
tho dough up with the soap; and in the evening they opened the door of tho hut and
pitched out the cakes and drew the attention
of the blacks to the grub supplied for their
gratification. There was a regular scramble
for the cakes, while the door was closed and
the inmates awaited the result. The effects of
the arsenic soon told upon the blacks, many of
whom rushed to the water and drank to repletion to allay tho burning inside. Some of the
most gluttonous dropped dead, and such a scare
was produced upon the tribe that they bolted,
being perfectly satisfied that the grub they
had so daringly demanded was not exactly the
kind of grub they desired.
This, I believe, was the first act of poisoning
the native cannibals in the colony, and I don't
believe there are many of the present generation who will blame Taylor and McGrath for
their action in self-defence. The men next
morning left for head-quarters, and the cattle
were scattered in every direction, causing a
heavy loss to the company. Many took to the
scrubs about Bundobah and Boolaydeelah, and
the destruction of the bulls years after afforded
many a day's sport to crack pistol-shots from
horseback' (The Daily Telegraph, 13 Jul, 1889, p 9).",-31.903,152.127,1834-01-01,1834-12-31,"<i>Wingham Chronicle</i>, April 25, 1922, p. 2 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166220492"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166220492</a>; <i>Newcastle Morning Herald</i>, July 25, 1964; Fitzpatrick, 1925, p 29;

37,td0d21,1336,"Goanna Headland, Evans Head",Site,"Rory Medcalf interviewed people in the Bundjuling community at Box Ridge and drew on the reminiscences of J T Olive of Woodburn whose father had been 'a squatter on the lower Richmond in the 1840s and took part in the Evans Head massacre' (Medcalf, 1993, p 5) to give a detailed account of a massacre at Goanna Headland.
<br>
According to Medcalf's narrative based on these sources, after Bundjuling people killed five white men at Pelican Creek in 1843, a group of 11 stockmen attacked a Bundjalung camp at Evans River and drove the Aboriginal people towards Goanna Headland where two schooners were sheltering from the southerly gale. The sailors on board joined in the shooting: 'Once within striking distance of the blacks a volley was poured into their ranks. Then the men aboard the schooners rushed for their guns and also opened fire on the tribe, who were mown down, the survivors fleeing in the distance. Altogether 100 darkies were killed on that headland, and for years afterwards the skulls could be picked up on the spot' (Olive in Medcalf, 1993, p 6).
<br>
Elder Mrs Mary Cowlan of Box Ridge said, 'Then the white men, they came along and shoot people ... I don't know the reasons ... they (the whites) didn't know blackfeller rules ... they had no pity, they killed women, men, children, babies' (Cowlan in Medcalf, 1993, p 6).
Elder Janet Gomes, said, 'Whitefellers started firing shots. There was no way out ... they (the Aborigines) were chased across the river from the Bundjalung Reserve' (Gomes in Medcalf, 1993, p 6).
<br>
Summarising the Bundjuling narratives, which are similar in many details to the colonist version, Medcalf wrote, 'It says the killings started at the riverbank campsite, and that the Aborigines were chased east to the headland, where at least one boatload of armed sailors was waiting.
The tribal group was all but annihilated, it says. They were the Birihn clans ... According to Douglas Cook, an Aboriginal elder from the Cabbage Tree Island community, who died in 1987, only two Birihn children survived the massacre' (Medcalf, 1993, p 6).",-29.113,153.445,1843-01-01,1843-12-31,"Medcalf 1993, p 5-7.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=632,2024-06-01 00:06:21,2024-11-17 15:29:54,632,"Bundjalung, Birihn",NSW,NSW,Grafton,1843,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,100,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,"Settler(s), Stockmen/Drover(s), Sailor(s)",Horse,Reprisal,"Firearm(s), Musket(s), Pistol(s), Sword(s), Blade(s)",**,5,,Dirawong,,,,27,11,6,Northern Rivers,Clarence and Richmond,Northern Rivers: Clarence and Richmond,East,South

Next day one of the two young men left to hold the 'quiet' cattle 'became troubled that some of the Aboriginal people may have been left injured by the fall from the cliff and dying a lingering death in the sun.

109,td628b,1336,De Grey Station,Site,"Some time in the middle of 1864 violent confrontations between colonists and local Ngarla people took place on the newly established De Grey Station in the Pilbara. 
<br>
In 1864 it was reported that, 'The De Grey natives had made a most determined attack
upon Mr. Nairn and his men, but were repulsed, and so severely punished as will probably teach them not to meddle with white men for some years to come' (The Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, Fri 12 Aug 1864, p 2).
<br>
More detail was reported later in 1886:
'At length, when all suspicion of hostility on the part of the blacks had died out, their savage instincts asserted themselves, and they concocted a plot, diabolical in its ingenuity, for destroying the whole of the white men. They decided to await the arrival of the Mystery with supplies, and when the latter had been landed and stored, it was arranged to have a grand corroboree to which all the white men would be invited, and when the latter were ail gathered close around, a large yamena (Dugong) net was to be drawn around them after which they could be speared without difficulty, the natives naturally concluding that the white victims
would come unarmed. Like many other well laid-plans, the diabolical scheme failed owing to being imperfectly carried out. On the evening in question Mr.
Nairn whilst sitting in his verandah after tea enjoying a pipe, was invited by two lusty blacks, to come over to the camp -- only about 200 yards off, where about 100
natives were congregated -- to see a corroboree. The other whites were also invited, but the latter not being quite ready the manager started away with the
two decoys, without the slightest suspicion of foul play. As they passed over the crest of a slight ridge between the house and camp the miscreants, evidently, wishing to have the honor of shedding first blood, turned upon Mr. Nairn and knocked him down, their accomplices rushing up with clubs to finish him. ln the meantime, a young man named Conway, who stood in the verandah watching the departure of Mr. Nairn and the two blacks, saw that something was wrong, so he called out to the men to arm themselves, and, seizing a revolver, rushed to the rescue of his chief, firing a shot from the revolver as he ran. This report startled the natives and gave Mr. Nairn a chance to get to his legs, when he ran towards Conway and seized the revolver, which, to his chagrin, would not go off again owing to the tumbler getting locked. However, by this time the other white men had reached the spot, and the blacks seeing that their plot had failed suddenly dispersed, leaving most of their newly formed clubs on the ground. As might be supposed, the little band, who had so narrowly escaped death, passed a sleepless night, and when day broke horses were saddled, and a party started on the tracks of the would-be murderers, whom they came upon about midday and
taught a lesson that they have never forgotten' (Western Mail, 6 March 1886, p13).

However local David Carley wrote 'it is very well-known by all old hands about Nickol Bay, and the 'Flying Foam Passage' that in one day there were quite sixty natives, men, women and children shot dead. The natives themselves have shown me the skulls of 15 who were shot. Three of the skulls were those of children, and two of these small skulls had bullet holes through them' (Carley, SROWA, Cons. 388, File 13). Historian Peter Gifford has recently described how the punitive party 'harried the Yaburara mercilessly, killing indiscriminately for weeks on end until the Resident Magistrate who had licensed this retribution, Robert John Sholl, now sickened by it, put an end to it' (Gifford 2017, p xii).

<br>The Battle of Minderoo
<br>by 'Tien Tsin', August, 1869. [Poem likely written by Richard Thatcher who was on the punitive expedition]
<br>'Twas Sabbath morn the rising sun had not appeared in view
<br>But day contested with the night at beauteous Minderoo
<br>The cork bark shed a sweet perfume the wild Ashburton pea
<br>Made sweeter still the morning air and birds sang merrily
<br>What means this band of armed men who ride on fiery steeds?
<br>What mission brings them thus abroad that so much caution needs
<br>No pannicans [sic] nor hobbled chains upon their saddles tied
<br>They seem to hold their very breath as o'er the plain they ride
<br>How slowly and how silently they're riding neck and neck
<br>The impatient neighing of a steed it's rider soon doth check
<br>The sun shows in the Eastern sky illumining the scene
<br>And lighting up the thick snake bush with leaves of heavy green
<br>The startled emu o'er the plain is quickly lost to view
<br>And from the gums with noisy screams there flies the cockatoo
<br>A smile comes oe'r [sic] the leaders face a smile that seems to show
<br>He feels that joy a warrior feels who meets a worthy foe
<br>For there some hundred yards ahead the dimly burning fire
<br>Betrays the presence of the foes to meet whom he desires—
<br>A foe both treacherous and cruel with cunning like to theirs
<br>He means now to surround their camp and take them unawares—
<br>They see the troop and starting up with wild discordant cries
<br>They yell like fiends and on the whites intimidation try
<br>They little know that leader bold who fought in many a field
<br>With stern commanding voice he cries on every man to yield
<br>They answer with their fighting spears most cruelly barbed in rows
<br>With cooeys and with club they try to disconcert their foes
<br>Now Hooley had that barbed spear but one inch nearer been
<br>But Heaven above—your wife and child you never more had seen
<br>Well shot bold Bob: that warrior his earthly course had run
<br>He'll never throw another spear nor view the setting sun
<br>Bold trooper Vincent's restive steed doth rear with all his force
<br>He only asks to fight on foot if one will hold his horse
<br>Now Ensign Willie's mare doth try from off the field to bolt
<br>She kicks and rears but still Will lets them taste his navy colt
<br>McRae confronts the dusky foe upon his well trained steed
<br>He fears no spears alike defies the coyles' whirling force
<br>An ugly smile upon his face most dangerous to see
<br>Descended evidently from a Scottish ancestry—
<br>His reins hang loosely on his arm his rifle grasped tight
<br>He sits just like one carved in stone and cooly takes a sight
<br>The leader of the savages the white man's arms defies—
<br>Encouraging his followers with yells and shouts and cries
<br>His left hand grasped a painted shield his right his spears and rest
<br>To strike the horses of the foe he bids them do their best—
<br>But suddenly his shield is dropped his spears are scattered round
<br>With loud despairing cry of rage he drops upon the ground
<br>A bullet from McRaes good piece has gone right through his brain
<br>He never more will use that shield nor throw those spears again
<br>Hurrah: cries Thatcher with delight that shot was worth a crown
<br>Another warrior bites the dust the boldest of them down
<br>Their leader gone and falling fast for mercy then they pray
<br>And send the prettiest women out to plead with bold McRae
<br>That flinty hearted champion the damsels proudly eyes
<br>He heeds not their entreating looks nor cares about their sighs
<br>Send out the old men and the boys we only fight with men
<br>Throw down your arms unship your spears we'll talk of quarter then
<br>They send out boys and aged men the nuncaberrys stay
<br>And fight like wolves or tigers till they're vanquished by McRae
<br>And there they lie upon the plain a ghastly sight to view
<br>Their life blood stains the clayey soil of beauteous Minderoo—
<br>By murdering natives on that plain a lesson may be read
<br>Whoso sheddeth blood of man by man shall his be shed.

Spence, Dr Callaghan, Lieutenant Walter Compigne of the Native Police, two black trackers and four [a]borigines, named Jack, Dundally, Tom and Paddle-nosed Peter' arrived on 'the southern end' of North Keppel Island to see if it was suitable for a cattle run. On the northern side of the island, they ambushed a group of Woppaburra people hiding in a cave (Bird, 1904, cited in Rowland, 2004, p 3). It appears that the native police shot seven or eight Woppaburra men and a woman with a cripple on her back. In his account Dr Callaghan did not mention the killings (see Rowland, 2004, pp 3-5). Two later accounts by R McClelland and Walter Roth, the Aboriginal Protector, were more forthcoming. McClelland said that when he visited the island some years later, 'the blacks showed me a line of bones over one hundred yards long, and told me that they belonged to a tribe of blacks who were shot by a boarding party of whites many years before...[and] and old black named ""Jamie"" told me all about the brutality of the shooting. He mentioned about an old gin who was trying to escape carrying a cripple on her back, and how both were mercilessly shot down' (McClelland cited in Rowland, 2004, p 5). In the 1890s, Walter Roth noted on his visit to North Keppel that 'the actual camping ground where at least 7 or 8 males were shot down one night in cold blood', was still to be seen, and that 'the father of one of the surviving gins (who described the scene that took place) being butchered while his little girl was clinging round his neck' (Roth cited in Rowland, 2004, p 5). It would appear that at least eight Woppaburra men were shot down along with a woman carrying the disabled child on her back.

Local residents were horrified by the killings and the incident was reported in the Rockhampton press (Queensland Times, 20 July 1867).

On 29 June 1875, Charles Henry Johnston, Abram Daer and Charles Rickards from the Daly River Telegraph station were attacked by Mangarrayi men at Roper Bar. Johnson died the next day. Too weak to bury Johnston, Daer and Rickards wrapped the body in canvas and oilskin and placed it together with a note under the foot of a tree and set off for Daly River Telegraph station, which they reached on 13 July. Daer died from his wounds on 7 August. While punitive expeditions were being organised to avenge the deaths, an overlanding party to Queensland, led by George De Lautour and William Batten, arrived at Roper Bar on 19 July and found Daer's note and Johnston's body and immediately set off in search of the Mangarrayi people.

A later article reported the 'hunting of natives' in the area, 'Whilst great regret has been felt at the loss of valuable lives like that of Mr. Johnston and Daer, not a little indignation has been expressed at the aimless nature of the Roper expedition and the indiscriminate ""hunting"" of the natives in the region. It is, of course, very desirable to strike terror into the hearts of the natives, in order to show them that the lives of the white men cannot be taken with impunity, but there ought to be a show of reason in the measure of vengeance dealt out to them.'

Following the killing of Charles Johnston at Roper Bar in the NT by Mangarrayi on 29 June 1875, two reprisal parties comprising 20 men assembled at Roper Bar on 2 August and, between 5 August and 4 September, conducted a series of massacres at Aboriginal camps in the region. On 29 August 1875, a party on foot attacked an Aboriginal camp on the north side of the Roper River under Calder Range. It is estimated that 40 people were shot. Roberts (2005, pp 115-124) takes up the story: ""As a consequence, Aboriginals along the length of the river were slaughtered by a massive party of police and civilians for four weeks solid in August 1875. Although the orders came from Inspector Paul Foelsche, the government's attack dog in Darwin, an operation of such size and cost, with a blaze of publicity, would have required approval from the government of Premier Sir James Penn Boucaut.  Foelsche issued these cryptic, but sinister, instructions: ""I cannot give you orders to shoot all natives you come across, but circumstances may occur for which I cannot provide definite instructions"". Roper River blacks had to be ""punished"". Foelsche wanted to go with them, but it was a large party, he said, with ""too many tale-tellers"". He boasted in a letter to a friend, John Lewis, that he had sent his second-in-command, Corporal George Montagu down to the Roper to ""have a picnic with the natives"". Even the normally enthusiastic Northern Territory Times was sickened by ""the indiscriminate 'hunting' of the natives there"", adding ""there ought to be a show of reason in the measure of vengeance dealt out to them"". Seven days earlier, the paper's response to the death of a prospector in Arnhem Land had not been so mild: ""Shoot those you cannot get at and hang those that you do catch on the nearest tree as an example to the rest"" (2009, np). Wilson (2000, pp 221-222) noted that 'This was Foelsche being duplicitous.

In 1911 James Beckett, the Chief Protector of Aborigines in the NT, was shown a remote cave north-west of the Limmen Bight River which contained forty to fifty skeletons of people of all ages. Beckett's Aboriginal guide said they had been killed by lightning many years earlier. An aged Aboriginal man told Beckett he had been taken to the site by his parents the day after the tragedy. There was, apparently, no obvious evidence that those in the cave had been shot, but in the first years of contact in the Gulf country it was common for Aboriginals to attribute shooting deaths to lightning. Moreover, the cave was reported to be 100 metres long, 20 metres wide and only '2 feet' (61 centimetres) high, which makes lightning an unlikely factor. In any event, news of the cave was published in the <i>Argus</i>, prompting an old-timer to write: ""Somewhere in the locality indicated, in a somewhat similar cave, over 25 years ago, I saw probably 20 bodies of natives who had recently been shot by a well-known Queensland overlander"".'",-15.156,135.636,1878-12-20,1878-12-22,"Reid, 1990, pp 86-87; Roberts, 2005, pp 48-50; <i>Evening Journal</i>, 20 Jan, 1879, p2 : <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/204436079/22391859"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/204436079/22391859</a>; Daly, 1887. pp 229-231.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=996,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:54,996,Yanyuwa,SA,NT,Port Darwin,December 1878,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,30,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Overlander(s),Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),***,William 'Bill' Travers,,,,,,44,9,3,Roper River,Calico Creek,Roper River: Calico Creek,North,North

Reprisals followed, as Roberts (2005, p 144) described: ""[Corporal George] Montague [sic] and Constable August Lucanus left Yam Creek on 16 July to investigate, collecting another constable at Pine Creek. They would be away for two months. Some forty years later, Lucanus wrote his memoirs for the <i>Perth Daily News</i> and his description of the search for Campbell's killers is the only record of what occurred. At Katherine the police recruited Jacob Peterson, who was with Jonathan Little's punitive party of 1875, and [Sam] Croker. Upon reaching Elsey [Station] they were joined by Palmer. Finding no trace of Campbell on the Strangways, they searched along the Roper. (p 145) At Red Lily Lagoon, where the party set up camp, a large number of Aboriginal people were fishing in bark canoes on the extensive network of lagoons and channels. Although they were frightened at first, one of the Aboriginal men approached the camp later in the day with some barramundi, which he exchanged for tobacco. Then Paddy and Peri [who had been with Campbell] arrived, desperately in need of tobacco. Tired of living with the tribe, they told about the murder, agreed to show where Campbell's body was buried near Mudla Waterhole, and where the saddles and other items were hidden. They said a Mungarrayi man named Charley, from Mole Hill, had smashed Campbell's skull with a nulla nulla while he slept and Paddy had finished him off. Peri would later give evidence that Campbell verbally abused and whipped Paddy, and they were afraid that one day he would murder them both. The police tried to induce Charley to come into the camp but he was too wily. 
""Remembering the murders of Johnston and Daer at the hands of Mungarrayi men seven years earlier, Montague <i>[sic]</i> is likely to have taken revenge on the tribe. His reactions to the Daly River copper mine murders in 1884 support this theory. Lucanus said nothing about casualties in his memoirs but Harold Thonemann, whose family owned Elsey and Hodgson Downs from 1914 to 1959, wrote that 'reprisals' followed Campbell's death. Thonemann took a keen interest in the local people during his time as manager and spoke with them at length about the old days. Whether the reprisals were carried out by Palmer's party or the police, or both, is unknown."" 
Lucanus' memoirs, however, have him camped at Red Lily Lagoon, although he admits to nothing.

Cumberoona's lands were principal camping grounds for local Aboriginal peoples [Wiradjuri], but Jobbins declared that the land was his, exclusively, and that harsh punishment would be administered to those that did not comply.' Jobbins led the attack with an unknown number of armed men on horseback.

258,td0e08,1336,"Mt Cottrell, Werribee",Site,"On July 9 1836, following the discovery of the mutilated bodies of Mr Charles Franks, a settler from VDL and his shepherd, Thomas Haines, a party of seventeen men armed with muskets, comprising eight male colonists, four Sydney Aborigines and five 'domesticated' Aborigines from the Port Phillip District (now Victoria), 'proceeded in search of the natives whom they supposed to be the murderers of Mr Franks and his shepherd' (Montagu cited in Cannon & McFarlane, 1982, p 42). The eight colonists were Henry Batman, John Wood, David Pitcairn, Mr Guy, Alexander Thomson, William Winberry, George Hollins and Michael Leonard; the four 'Sydney Aborigines' included Bullett, Stewart and Joe the Marine and the four Port Phillip Aborigines included Benbow, Derrymock, Ballayann and Baitlainge. John Montagu, the Colonial Secretary in Van Diemen's Land, wrote about the incident to his counterpart in New South Wales on 18 August 1836: 'They came up with a tribe, consisting of men, women and children, to the number of about fifty to one hundred, and perceiving upon the persons of some of them articles which were recognised as having belonged to Mr Franks, a rencontre followed. It is not stated however what resistance the natives made, but none of the opposing party were injured, although it is feared that there can be little doubt that ten of the tribe of Port Phillip natives were killed' (Cited in Cannon & McFarlane 1982, p 42). William Lonsdale, magistrate at Port Phillip from late September 1836, was instructed by the Colonial Secretary in Sydney, to investigate the incident. However none of the perpetrators he interviewed would acknowledge the 'rencontre' although it was clear that each of them had something to hide. Those interviewed by Lonsdale were: Henry Batman; John Wood; Michael Leonard; and William Winberry. Winberry acknowledged that a party went after the blacks and that they were found and 'several shots were fired', and that a child was found 'belonging to the fugitives', but he did 'not see that any of the blacks were killed or hurt'. (Winberry cited in Cannon & McFarlane 1982,  p 48) Leonard said that the  murderers of Franks and Flinders were Aboriginal men,  'Callen and Dundom'. Leonard heard that  in relation to the reprisal, 'some were wounded' but he paid 'no attention to it'. (Leonard cited in Cannon & McFarlane, p 49)  Was Charles Franks entirely blameless? C.E. Sayers, the editor of  T.F. Bride's 'Letters from Victorian Pioneers', notes that settler Robert William von Stieglitz reported that: 'On my way [to the Werribee] I met with a Mr Franks and got some lead from him to make what he called blue pills for the natives, who were very fierce' (Bride 1983, p 88).",-37.769,144.634,1836-07-16,1836-07-16,"Cannon & McFarlane 1982, p 41-52; <i>Cornwall Chronicle</i > July 30, 1836, p 2 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65954557"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65954557</a>; Sayers, 1983, p.88;  Boyce 2011, p 105-9; Rogers, et.al., 2016, p 89-90 & 92-4.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=504,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:53,504,Wathawurrung,PPD,VIC,Melbourne,16/07/1836,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,10,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,"Aboriginal, Settler(s)",Foot,Reprisal,"Firearm(s), Musket(s)",***,"2 colonists, Charles Franks and Thomas Flinders (killed 09/07/1836) whose mutilated bodies were found.","Men, women and children: 10 of the whole clan of 50 to 100.",,,,,78,0,0,South Road,Kulin,South Road: Kulin,South East,South

That night eight sheep went missing and on the following day, 8 April, the 19 stockmen and shepherds moved camp to the south bank of the Broken River only to be followed. On 9 April more Yorta Yorta arrived and on 11 April, Faithfulls' men prepared to strike camp with the stockmen departing first. Then 20 warriors attacked. One of the shepherds fired and killed a warrior, another fired and missed and the other eight shepherds ran away only to be struck down and killed. Four or five stockmen escaped to report the incident. According to historian Judith Bassett who conducted the most detailed research on the massacre, it 'bore all the hallmarks of traditional and specific revenge, whereby a small, ritually sanctioned group of Aborigines took their victim(s) by surprise and then returned quickly to their camp.'(Bassett 1989, p 23) They did not seek to kill every white man present.

Coppock led a party of eight white men from both stations in search of the Aboriginal camp and the sheep.

These spears dropped by us and passed as we were obliged to shelter ourselves behind trees.' 
'We fired upon the blacks and there was a regular engagement for about three-quarters of an hour, when we rushed up to the fires to take possession of the place. When we got to the fires the blacks had deserted them, but we saw them about one or two hundred yards off still in possession of the sheep. It was at this time quite dark and we were afraid to make any further attempt to take the sheep. We therefore went home.'
'At the place where the blacks stood during the engagement we found seven or eight blacks dead' (Coppock cited in Cannon & Macfarlane 1982a, p 337). When Coppock and six stockmen returned to the camp the next day, they 'found the bodies of the blacks who had been killed had been put upon the fire and were partly consumed' (Cannon & Macfarlane, 1982A, p 338). However, since Aboriginal people did not dispose of bodies in this way, it can only be assumed that Coppock and his party put them 'upon the fire'.",-37.101,144.413,1838-06-09,1838-06-09,"Cannon & Macfarlane, 1982, pp 336-340;

According to Clark (1995, p 92), G.A. Robinson said that the site was at the junction of two creeks  12 kilometres from Bowerman's outstation, and that Sievwright 'found a small piece [of] cranium under a piece of log' and that several huts in the district, including that occupied by William Allen, 'had Aboriginal skulls placed over their doors' (Clark, 1995, pp 92-3). 'John Davis and Abraham Braybrook were committed for trial for the killings. However, owing to the lack of corroborating evidence from white men, the attorney general [J.H. Plunkett], refused to prosecute the two men for anything other than the misdemeanour of burning the bodies' and even of that, the men were subsequently acquitted (Robinson Papers cited in Clark 1995, p. 93). According to Chief Protector GA Robinson, the two men 'were not wholly cleared of guilt and the public prosecutor recommended that they be turned to the public works'. However, they were returned to Burrumbeet station where Robinson saw Braybrook on 27 February 1840 (Robinson cited in Clark 1998a, p. 180). The Rev. Joseph Orton presented the following summary of Sievwright's report (dated 17 April 1839) 'Allen, the overseer to Bowerman, had instructed the shepherds at the outstations to inform him immediately any natives made their appearance that he might be prepared for them. On one occasion the natives did come and were quiet and friendly, but the servants having received peremptory orders from Mr Allen to inform him when the natives came, they accordingly did so.  Allen immediately ordered his horse to be saddled and rode in search of them and found the natives a few miles from the shepherds' station and warned them not to come near the station' (this incident relates to the massacre of 10-14 Aborigines being killed in July 1838). 'Allen left orders again with the shepherds not to allow the natives near. The men, however, said they were peaceable and they were desirous to keep on good terms with them. A short time after this the blacks came to the shepherds hut and under suspicion that they came to rob the hut an affray commenced and from six to eight Aborigines were shot by the white men. The bodies were burned the next day. It appears in the deposition that a native woman was in the hut with the white men. In answer to a question Allen acknowledged that he had ordered the men to protect themselves. Davies, a prisoner, shot most or all. The above is the substance of the depositions and admissions of the implicated parties which is of course the <i>ex parte</i> statement. Allen was bound to appear when called for in recognisance of 200 pounds. In this case nothing more has been done than taking the depositions of the aggressors and murderers. There being no evidence but their own and that of the Aborigines – in the former case the accused cannot incriminate himself in a court of justice and in the latter Aboriginal evidence is inadmissible. Thus these miscreants elude justice and boast in their foul deeds – which accounts for the apparent frankness of their depositions' (Orton  1840-42,  12 January 1841, cited in Clark, 1995, p 89-90).",-37.446,143.735,1839-02-01,1839-02-28,"Orton Journal, 1840-42, 12 Jan 1841, cited in Clark 1995, pp 89-90;  Cannon and Macfarlane 1983, pp 642-643; Clark ID 1995, pp 89-90; 92-93; Clark, 1998, p 192 (Robinson Journals).",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=512,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,512,Djadjawurrung,PPD,VIC,Geelong,February 1839,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,6,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,Settler(s),Foot,Opportunity,Firearm(s),***,,,,,,,0,0,0,South Road,West,South Road: West,South East,South

He is alleged to have retrieved the sheep  48kms away.  According to EO Randell, historian of the Campaspe Plains pastoral stations, upon his return, Hutton called on magistrate William Yaldwyn at nearby Barfold Station where a detachment of infantry was camped and asked for protection. Yaldwyn refused saying that Assistant Protector Edward Parker was in the district and it was his duty to address the issue and that foot soldiers would be of little help. Another settler Thomas Thornloe reported the details to GB Smyth Officer in Charge of the Mounted Police in Melbourne and advised that a punitive expedition should be sent against the Aborigines to 'teach them a lesson' (Randell 1982, p 289).

The culminating point of this policy was when the cook, who was in charge of the rations, either under instructions from his employer or otherwise, distributed to the Aborigines a mixture of flour and Plaster of Paris. Though this was a better mixture than the arsenic given them elsewhere in Victoria, we can imagine the ""damper"" which resulted.' The Aborigines, 'to whom this act was probably the last of a great many indignities, speared the cook and helped themselves to the quarters of mutton hanging from the rafters.' In retribution, 'McLachlan and his men caught up with the Aborigines at a waterhole on Middle Creek where they were about to feast on the mutton. The Aborigines sought safety by diving into the waterhole and there they were shot, one at a time, as they came up for air.

In a letter to Lieutenant Governor La Trobe on 8 September 1853 George Faithful wrote that, 'The country was left to us for some years in consequence of the hostility of the blacks,
which became so unbearable that I could not keep shepherds,
although well armed, without employing a horseman, in addition
to myself, to keep continually perambulating the woods lest the
natives might cut them off' (Bride, 1889, p 151).
<br>
George Faithfull went on to describe a massacre that lasted for many hours:
'At last, it so happened that I was the means of putting an end to this warfare. Riding with two of my stockmen one day
quietly along the banks of the river, we passed between the anabranch of the river itself by a narrow neck of land, and, after proceeding about half a mile, we were all at once met by some
hundreds of painted warriors with the most dreadful yells I had
ever heard. Had they sprung from the regions below we could have hardly been more taken by surprise. Our horses bounded
and neighed with fear - old brutes, which in other respects required an immense deal of persuasion in the way of spurs to make
them go along. Our first impulse was to retreat, but we found the narrow way blocked up by natives two and three deep, and we
were at once saluted with a shower of spears. My horse bounded
and fell into an immense hole. A spear just then passed over
the pummel of my saddle. This was the signal for a general
onset. The natives rushed on us like furies, with shouts and savage
yells; it was no time for delay. I ordered my men to take
deliberate aim, and to fire only with certainty of destruction to the individual aimed at. Unfortunately, the first shot from one of my men's carbines did not take effect; in a moment we were
surrounded on all sides by the savages boldly coming up to us. It was my time now to endeavour to repel them. I fired my double barrel right and left, and two of the most forward fell; this stopped the impetuosity of their career. I had time to reload,
and the war thus begun continued from about ten o'clock in the morning until four in the afternoon. We were slow to fire, which
prolonged the battle, and 60 rounds were fired, and I trust and
believe that many of the bravest of the savage warriors bit the
dust' (Bride, 1898, p 152).
<br>
According to James Howard, aged 83 in 1883, he was a shepherd on George Faithfull's run at Oxley Plains in 1841 when the 'blacks played sad havoc with Faithfull's cattle and sheep, whereupon the stockmen, shepherds, and hut keepers turned out, mounted and armed, to the number of about 18, fell upon the blacks in camp on the bank of the King above Oxley, and massacred them.

19,td0cd3,1336,Moira Swamp,Site,"Following the killing of two employees at Horatio Spencer Wills' station 'Calimo' (Tumudgery) on the Edward River near present day Deniliquin in NSW, and the loss of several hundred sheep at other stations along the River Murray, on 24 November 1843, Superintendent La Trobe ordered Henry Dana, of the native police, Crown Lands Commissioner Henry Smythe and his Murray District border police, to each take a detachment of their mounted men to the Murray River at Barmah and Moira Lakes, to investigate (Robinson 24 November 1843 in Clark 1998, pp. 213-214). La Trobe was responding to a letter from Henry Bingham, Commissioner of Crown Lands, based at Tumut in NSW, seeking help. Dana and  Smythe and their detachments were accompanied by settlers Henry S. Lewis, Edward Hogg and John Oldbury Atkinson and by a detachment of Bingham's border police led by Sgt James. (Franklin 2021, p.49) The entire party is estimated to have comprised about 20 horsemen.
<br>
An encounter took place in the Moira Swamps on 15 December 1843. When Dana returned to Melbourne he sent a brief report to La Trobe on 1 January 1844, saying that he had joined Smythe's party 'on the Murray' and that his men had 'behaved exceedingly well and were of the greatest use in the expedition.' (Dana in Franklin 2021, p. 45)
<br>
However Assistant Protector William Thomas had already heard that several  people were killed and confronted Dana about it. In response Dana 'abused him...in a violent manner, damned and threatened to kick him.' (Robinson 3 Jan 1844 in Clark 1998, p. 1) On 8 January 1844, the <i>Geelong Advertiser</i> reported that Thomas had charged Dana with 'the murder of several natives!' and that an investigation was under way. On 4 January 1844, Dr James Allen, Robinson's son-in-law and medical officer at Narre Warren Aboriginal station, told Robinson that 'the blacks had told him that a number of men also women were shot by Dana's party at the Murry [sic] and the children were knocked on the head with carrabines. They first sent a party to look for the natives and then went and planted themselves in a scrub and sent two or three troopers to round or drive them up like sheep to be large party carrelled; they then commenced firing and shot some of them in the river etc.' Dana told Robinson that 'he had had a brush with the natives. He went to the Murray by the Campaspe [River] and returned said 20 men, one woman, five children were shot.' (Robinson 5 January 1844 in Clark 1998, p.2)
<br>
The inquiry exonerated Dana but did not record the number of people killed. (<i>Port Phillip Gazette</i> 31 January 1844). However, on 17 April 1844, former Sergeant Edward Broderick of Smythe's mounted border police, wrote to La Trobe complaining of his recent dismissal from the force and that he had kept quiet about the illegal shootings of Aboriginal people at the Murray River on 15 December 1843. Smythe and his men had attacked an Aboriginal camp and shot men, women and children 'indiscriminately' and that his evidence could be supported by the three settlers and Sgt James. (Broderick to La Trobe 17 April 1844 in Franklin 2021, pp. 46-49) La Trobe demanded an explanation from Smythe and the three settlers. However, they all said that they fired in self-defence and there was no indiscriminate firing. Smythe said that two Aboriginal men were killed and one woman was wounded in the wrist. Edward Hogg said that Broderick did most of the firing. (Smythe to La Trobe 26 April 1844; Statement by Edward Hogg, 5 June 1841 in Franklin 2021, pp. 54-9).
<br>
The inquiry came to an end in August 1844, when the Colonial Secretary in Sydney said that Governor Gipps could see 'no reason to suppose that Mr Smythe encouraged or sanctioned the exercise of any unnecessary severity towards the Natives, on the unfortunate occasion of his collision with them in the Swamp called ""Moira""'. (Col Sec to La Trobe 16 August 1844 in Franklin 2021, p. 61) This incident is one of very few that led to two formal inquiries. In each case, the ringleaders, Dana and Smythe, were exonerated.

The servant was so much hurt by them with spears and clubs, as to be in danger of losing his life. A few days after this circumstance, a body of natives having attacked the settlers, and carried off all their clothes and provisions, and whatever else they could lay their hands on, the sufferers [on 1 September 1795] collected what arms they could, and following them, seven or eight of the plunderers were killed on the spot.'

This was the first attempt at European settlement in Northern Australia.  There is no record of how many Tiwi Islanders were killed, although reports of deaths put the figure as 'minimal' notwithstanding heavy fortification and the posting of sentries. It is reported that the Tiwi consider the abandonment of Fort Dundas as a victory in repelling the English from their soil, which was threatened by grass and tree cutting and voracious use of precious water supplies.
Reid (1990, p 17) wrote that Captain Gordon Bremer arrived on 23 September with fifty marines and soldiers, and several wives and children, but without official instructions as to how he should handle the local people.  He had merely been told they were 'understood to be of a ferocious disposition'. Within a month the Tiwi had attacked, and one was shot in reprisal.  Thereafter the Aborigines were seldom seen but they tore down huts, speared the livestock, stole the tools of working parties. Warruminguand, in October 1826, killed a white man.

In November 1827 the surgeon, Dr John Gold, and storekeeper, John Henry Green, walking near Fort Dundas, were attacked and killed. By this time it was apparent that Apsley Strait was unsuitable as a trading settlement.

The settlement [Fort Wellington] had been established only a year earlier, following clashes with the Tiwi people at Fort Dundas on nearby Melville Island. John Sweatman, the clerk on board <i>HMS Bramble</i> which visited the fort  in 1846, recorded both the event and the effect the killings would have had on the Iwaidja: 'Here [at Fort Wellington] the party again found the natives hostile and after being perpetually attacked, Capt. Smythe, the commandant, determined to try the effect of a severe lesson; he accordingly turned his people out and in one night shot about 30 of the natives, the rest flying for their lives. The consequence of this decisive measure may be imagined, when it is remembered that the severest conflicts of the natives themselves often involve the loss of more than one life, and even that is sufficient to throw a whole tribe into the deepest sorrow and frenzy: it quite settled the matter, no more natives were seen for some months' (Allen & Corris, 1977, pp 135-136).

155,td0cf0,1336,Adai,Site,"Following the massacre of people aboard the shipwrecked Sperwer at Prince of Wales Island, Police Magistrate and Commissioner of Crown Lands, John Jardine of the Native Police led an expedition, witnessed bodies of the victims and returned with some items from the shipwreck. Memmott et al summarise several accounts of what happened during Jardine's expedition, which indicate a reprisal massacre took place (Memmot et al, 2021).
<br>
Jardine reported that '... I requested the use of two boats with their crews from Captain McAusland, of the schooner Melanie, which i got, and went over with four native troopers to the Prince of Wales Island...' (<i>The Brisbane Courier</i> 9 November 1869, p 3) but did not report any reprisal killing. However, by the time this was published, a journalist, R. Thatcher, had already reported that Captain McEnroe had visited the island to trade and that, 'He returned to Cape York and told Mr. Frank Jardine, the police magistrate, what he had seen and that gentleman, being a Queensland magistrate, and consequently not hampered by any absurd aboriginal protection instructions, immediately organized a party of mainland natives (Zardigans) and assisted by some Tanna men from the Melanie went over to the island, crept on the dastardly wretches at daylight, and ""dispersed"" the men of the tribe, justly avenging a most brutal and unprovoked outrage' (<i>The Herald</i>, 30 Oct 1869, p 3).
<br>
Soon after, in 1870, a letter from Chas. Edwards was published, in response to 'many incorrect statements' about 'the capture of the Sperwer' which described what happened when he arrived with Jardine: 'On anchoring near Prince of Wales Island, we found the natives unaccountably shy, contrary to their usual habit... at last we got into intercourse with them, and after buying a lot of tortoise-shell from them, they said they had a lot more in their camp, on which Mr Jardine and Captain MacAuslin started inland for the camp, much against the natives' will.' There they found the Sperwer's log book and other items. Edwards then says that a camp was rushed but some were spared in the 'skirmish' as they were related to the mainland Aboriginal people with Jardine. 'After searching Wednesday and the surrounding islands, and not finding any traces of a wreck, Mr Jardine considered it his duty to search Prince of Wales Island... Returning to Somerset, Mr. Jardine mustered a party of native police, and some natives of a neighbouring tribe; we, on Mr. Jardine's requisition, furnishing two boats with their crews, in charge of the master and mate, for transit of the party to Prince of Wales island. On arriving there the old camp was found to be deserted, and for two days the party had a toilsome search; at last the new camp was found and rushed, and a quantity of cabin gear, cooking utensils, clothes, books, some Dutch florins, &c., and amongst other things a pair of baby's worsted stockings and some exercises in algebra, written in a boy's hand, were found, but nothing else that would testify to the presence of a woman on board. Some of the island natives were related to the natives from the mainland, and were protected by them in the skirmish, and returned with the party' (<i>The Inquirer and Commercial News</i>, 5 January 1870, p 3).
<br>
Following this Police Magistrate Henry Chester travelled to the island with troopers and executed a further three people (Memmot et al, 2021, p 38). Memmot et al also provide later sensationalised accounts of the reprisals by the showman Archibald Meston (Memmott et al., 2021, pp 40-2).. The massacre is also recorded in Kaurareg tradition. 'Kaurareg leader Milton Savage has described a large camp on Prince of Wales Island named ""Adai"", aka ""Thaimerau Karai"" (a village campsite) in a gulley between two hills near Port Lihou Channel; ""Our people survived in other campsites all around the island, but this one, the large campsite, was totally massacred""' (Memmot et al, 2021, p 42).",-10.707,142.213,1869-07-01,1869-01-31,"Memmott et al, 2021 <a href=""https://doi.org/10.17082/j.2205-3239.12.1.2021.2021-03"">https://doi.org/10.17082/j.2205-3239.12.1.2021.2021-03</a>;

Sabben and his men landed at Clump Point, Mission Beach and were confronted by about 120 Djiru people. 
'Whilst engaged in cooking we
were suddenly surprised by a terrific yell from
about 120 natives who rushed out from the mangrove bushes,
300 yards from the boat, with the intention of capturing
her. This, however, was frustrated by my crew getting
there first, and when the nearest of the natives were
within eighty yards I opened fire on them, but at the first
volley three of the six rifles missed fire, and on examination
it was found all the powder had got wet, as it had
rained a great deal during the morning, and we had also
shipped some water in the boat on our way up. We had
now only our own three Sniders to trust to. Our first
volley was returned by the natives (who were each armed
with a sword, shield, and boomerang) with a volley of
stones, which they kept up to the end of the fight with
great rapidity, but, strange to say, not a stone struck any

They then searched for survivors and attacked camps:
'We next proceeded to Tam o'Shanter's Point,
and from this point to Clump Point (the site of Mr. Sabben's encounter) a most vigorous search was made.
A large camp was found, which was rushed, and several
blacks dispersed. In this camp we found a large quantity
of the murdered men's effects, and some charred bones;
other effects were also found in two other camps to the
southward. This completed all traces of the wrecked men.
In this expedition some few natives were killed, and all the
camps between the points above mentioned were destroyed.' (Sydney Morning Herald, 6 Apr 1872, p 8)
<br>
Captain Moresby recorded that, 'On our arrival, Mr. Sabben came and reported his execution of this service to me, and Mr. Sheridan met me with a magisterial requisition for assistance, rendered necessary by the fact that various murders and acts of violence had been committed by the blacks of late near Cardwell. It concluded in these words—""If some immediate action is not taken, no boat will be safe on the coast, and I am afraid that the settlers outside the town, or even the town itself, may be attacked by the savages."" I therefore aided him to send his black troopers and their officers to the scene of the latest murder—that of the boat's crew of the ""Maria"" (there to inflict a decisive punishment), by embarking them on board the ""Peri"",—sending with them three officers and twelve men of H.M.S. ""Basilisk"", under the command of Lieutenant Francis Hayter. It is needless to say that I felt it very painful to take such a step, but in Mr. Sheridan's opinion as well as my own it was necessary, not only for the sake of justice, and in the interests of all white men who might hereafter be placed at the mercy of the tribe, but to secure the safety of Cardwell itself. The tribe was surprised before daylight,—several unfortunate blacks were shot down by the native troopers, who showed an unrestrained ferocity that disgusted our officers; and the camp, in which some clothing and effects of the four murdered men were found, was destroyed. This work of justice over, the party returned to Cardwell, bringing with them a little native lad about six years old, whose father had been shot.' (Moresby, 1876, Ch. IV, pp 28-29)

as volunteers] — as well as a crew of Water Police, with a supply of arms and ammunition' (The Queenslander, 6 Apr, 1872, p 9). At Cardwell he was joined by 'Sub-lieutenant Jones, from the Basilisk... and a detachment of native police under the command of Mr. Johnstone' (The Queenslander, 6 Apr, 1872, p 9). This group set out after the voyage of the Peri on 17 March, 1872 and so was the third expedition to rescue survivors and kill Djiru people at Mission Beach. 
<br>
According to Gowlland 'Each boat's crew detached an armed landing
party, who walked along the beaches, and over
the rocks, and whenever feasible, made excursions in various directions through the dense
scrub and jungle which fringed the shore of the
mainland.
A strong party of volunteers, reinforced by
the native trackers, forced their way inland
along the banks of the river which falls into the
sea at the spot marked Shoalhaven on the plan,
through an all but impassable country, and in
their passage intersected the footmarks ot blacks
in numerous directions.
Every native camp between Cardwell and
Point Cooper [north of Johnstone River], a distance of about fifty miles,
was visited and minutely searched for any traces
of white men that might permit us to hope that
some of our missing countrymen might even still
be alive, though languishing in captivity.
A second party with two boats, and accompanied by Mr. Johnstone and the native police
were sent to examine the banks of a large river,
still further to the northward [Mulgrave River], marked on the
plan as Shoal Rivulet. They were absent about
two days, but with the exception of a felt hat
found in a native encampment four miles north
of the river, no traces of the existence of living
white men in this neighborhood were discovered' (The Queenslander, 6 Apr, 1872, p 9).
<br>
Gowlland's report published in the Queenslander does not include details of any people killed. Dr Tate, a surgeon who was on board both the Peri and the Governor Blackall expeditions wrote that 'Lieutenant Gowlland, of the Governor Blackall, for reasons unknown to me, was so inconsiderate as not to send me, the only surgeon on board his vessel ashore, for the purpose of examining the different bodies found, though I had repeatedly requested him to do so' (The Queenslander, 13 Apr 1872, p 8).
<br>
According to Timothy Bottom's footnotes, a later report provides details of the people killed on this expedition. This report is cited as 'Sub-Inspector Johnstone to Captain Gowlland, Ship ""Governor Blackall,"" 22 March 1872, Annexure No.3, p.5 of J T Gowlland RN, ""New Guinea Expedition per Brig 'Maria.'

According to this report, 'On 21 March 1872, R A ""Johnstone and his trackers having given a very good account of the sixteen he came across"" (p.21) and the next day ""Mr Johnstone's trackers [ie troopers] shot 27 of the Blacks in the Camp"" (p.22)' (Bottoms, 2013, p 234). Based on this report Timothy Bottoms writes, 'A week later Johnstone confirmed to Lieutenant Gowlland the killings that had already occurred: ""I have also to state that I have severely punished the guilty parties having found the property of the missing men in their possession."" Johnstone and his troopers shot a total of 43 Djiru' (Bottoms, 2013, p 135).",-17.52,146.059,1872-03-17,1872-03-22,"Moresby, 1876, pp 28-30 <a href=""http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1301151h.html"">http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1301151h.html</a>; <i>Queenslander</i> April 6, 1872, p 9 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27270473"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27270473</a> and April 13, 1872, p 8 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27270598"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27270598</a>; Bottoms, 2013, pp 134-135.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=968,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:54,968,Djiru,QLD,QLD,Cardwell,March 1872,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,43,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,"Native Police, Sailor(s), Police",Boat,Reprisal,Muzzle Loading Rifle(s),***,14 crew of the 'Maria' shipwreck,"Men, women and children.",,,"1872: ‘Maria’ reprisal massacres, QLD",,36,20,11,Tropical Coast,Early,Tropical Coast: Early,North East,North

On 15th March 1858 W. Cryand wrote to Government Resident at Moreton Bay saying, '...while the Colonial Secretary is quite prepared to hear, after the numerous murders and other acts of atrocity committed by the Aborigines in the Southern Districts, that summary and severe punishment had ensued, he regrets to notice in the reports of Lieutenants Murray and Powell expressions which he cannot permit to pass by without special notice. Lieutenant Murray in his letter to the Commandant of the 19 January last says ""a considerable number of Blacks concerned in the late outrage have been killed by the Police, finding that they were allowed up to the Station <u>and evidently thinking that their evil deeds had been forgotten</u>""; and the expression to which the Colonial Secretary Secretary entertains objection is that portion of the above that is underlined. It, I am to say, would justify the inference that unawares and possibly while entrapped within reach of gun shot, they were in cold blood destroyed. But a still more objectionable expression occurs in Lieutenant Powell's letter of 16th December last, in which he reports that in dispersing a large party of Blacks some of them were shot including ""<u>three Gins as they were running away</u>""... The murder of the Fraser Family with the attendant circumstances required that the perpetrators of such monstrous enormities should be punished in the severest manner wherever they could be found; but I am desired to state that there is something abhorrent to the feeling of humanity to read, even on that case, of three Gins being shot dead as they were running away, and the Colonial Secretary trusts that on any future occasion should a similar occurrence be reported, you will make enquiry at once into the matter in order to check the feeling that the lives even of the most ignorant savages may be unnecessarily taken from them.'

Continuation of the Dawson Murders', the Moreton Bay Courier published a request from a squatter, Mr Sericold, for 'the Government, to take further steps for the suppression of the murders which are being continually perpetrated on our helpless shepherds on the Dawson River.' Sericold described a 'labyrinth' of cliffs and gorges in a large horseshoe shape around the upper Dawson, used by Aboriginal people to elude colonists. He added that 'from a communication I have just had with some of the Cockatoo tribe, I find that there has been a great ""yabba,"" which has resulted in all the gins, picaninnies, and old men being sent into the Burnett, and the fighting men deciding on war' (<i>MBC</i>, 9 June 1858, p2).
<br>
A Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly recommended deployment of additional mounted police, Native Police and a militia of settlers to the area, and that the troopers be 'under military law' (<i>The Darling Down Gazette and General Advertiser</i>, 26 Aug 1858, p 4).
<br>
After a colonist was killed, on the 12th November, 1859 Second Lieutenant Carr with Native Mounted Police went 15 miles from Glenmore station (near Rockhampton) to the scene of the killing, and then another 15 miles in the direction of 'Coonoomoo' (possibly Commooboolaroo, south west of Dauringa) where they encountered a camp in scrub near the river bed. Second Lieutenant Carr wrote, 'On our approach the Blacks rushed from the camp, and were pursued by the Troopers, two Blacks were killed and sixteen Prisoners taken.' Lieutenant Murray returned with 3 captives and from their information obtained warrants for 'King John', 'Bueen', 'Billy' and 'Motzie' (QSA COL/A26/1860/79).
<br>
On 18 November 1859, Second Lieutenant Murray (not to be confused with Lieutenant John Murray) reported that 'having received information on the 8th of a mob of Blacks being in the vicinity of one of Messrs Kelmans and Duttons Sheep Stations I proceeded in that direction.' (QSA COL/A26/1860/79) He reached their camp 10 miles from these stations. 
<br>
'I ascertained there was one amongst them named ""Billy Billy""; as I hold a warrant for a Black of that name I tried to prevent them making with the scrub which was close to, but failed in doing so. On the troopers passing into the scrub in pursuit, the Blacks made a rush and attacked them.' Hand to hand combat followed and 'The Blacks got one of the troopers down, and gave him several blows on the head with a ""nulla nulla""... The Blacks stood their ground for about half and hour, when we succeeded in dispersing them, leaving six of their number dead, and many more wounded. The one named ""Billy Billy"" was shot in the act of throwing a waddy at one of the Troopers' (QSA COL/A26/1860/79).

An article on the origins of placenames in Central Queensland records that 'COORADA Station, Upper Dawson, until 1856 portion of Ghinghindah Station held by Kelman, who, in that year sold the portion to Blaid and Hobler' (<i>The Central Queensland Herald</i>, 24 Aug 1950, p 16). Murray's letter mentions that he tracked survivors the next day to Zamia Creek, which is north west of Ghinghindah (Robinson, 1933). This suggests the massacre occurred in scrub about 10 miles north west of Ghinghindah. On writing the letter on the 18th, he said that he had been away 9 days, and having left on the 8th, the massacre may have been around the 12th November, 1859.

In a letter to the Commandant in Brisbane, dated 8 December, 1859, Lieutenant John Murray wrote that, 'From every appearance of affairs, in this River [the Dawson], I am of opinion that the Blacks are determined to lose no opportunity of murdering and robbing and it is almost impossible to deal satisfactorily with them.'

Lieutenant Carr's report of 30th October, 1861 stated that there had been an '... affray with Blacks, which took place at the Native Police Camp on the Maranoa River' and that '... the Blacks dispersed and went towards the head of the river, nothing has been heard of them since, I have however instructed Mr Marlow to make a patrol in that direction to ascertain something of their movements' (Carr to Commandant of the Native M. Police, Rockhampton in QSA COL/A23/61/3266, (DR 57342.pdf) ITM846753, p 169).
Second Lieutenant Marlow's report of 22 October, 1861 stated that on the 19th of October 6 unarmed Aboriginal people approached the police camp. With one of the native police interpreting, he explained to them that they should not come near the police camp and they left immediately. 'I believing that these six men were merely spies from the main body came up according to the usual customs of the wilder tribes, I prepared for the result should they return armed in force. I did not saddle up as I wished to show them that the camp was safe without the horses, and as I had no charge against them I would have let them go in peace if they would let me.
Shortly after the first lot thirty apparently picked men came up, fully armed, they gave me no opportunity of speaking to them but at once commenced an attack upon us. I accordingly led my men to close quarters and after a sharp struggle dispersed them with a loss of ten men on their side. I was insensible for a short period during the engagement from a wound on the head, one of the men also got struck but not severely' (Marlow to Carr, 22 Oct, 1861 in QSA COL/A23/61/3266, (DR 57342.pdf) ITM846753, pp 170-171).",-26.15,147.949,1861-10-19,1861-10-19,"Collins, 2002, p 213; QSA COL/A23/61/3266, (DR 57342.pdf) ITM846753, pp 164 - 171 <a href=""https://www.archivessearch.qld.gov.au/items/ITM846753"">https://www.archivessearch.qld.gov.au/items/ITM846753</a>",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=649,2024-06-01 00:06:21,2024-11-17 15:29:54,649,Gungabula,QLD,QLD,Taroom,19/10/1861,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,10,,Colonists,0,Native Police,Horse,Opportunity,"Firearm(s), Rifle(s)",***,,,,,,,30,16,7,Upper Dawson,South West,Upper Dawson: South West,North East Inland,North
370,td0d52,1336,Nogoa River,Site,"The news of the massacre of nineteen colonists at Mr Wills's station at Cullin la Ringo first reached Mr Gregson at Rainworth station, when two shepherds who escaped the massacre arrived there. Before the native police could arrive, who were a long distance away at the time (QSA GOV/23/61/74 (DR110747) ITM17671, p124), two groups of colonists set out for the Nogoa. 'Mr Gregson's party overtook some of the miscreants at dawn one morning, revelling in their blankets and ill-gotten booty. The party managed to get one discharge at the wretches, when they all bolted up a steep range, till the sight of the white's destroying their spears and boomerangs, which were splendid in appearance, drew them down upon the little band, who wisely retreated, fearing they might be cut off from their horses, which were left a mile and a half from the scene of action' (The Courier, 11 Nov 1861, pp 2-3).
<br>
This article mentions another group led by Mr P.F. Macdonald had also gone out to 'protect the stock, and assist the survivors' (The Courier, 11 Nov 1861, pp 2-3). P.F.McDonald wrote in his account that this second group did not encounter any Aboriginal people:
'As it had been fully ascertained that the great portion of blacks implicated in the murders belonged to the Comet and Dawson Rivers, and had made off in that direction, we started on the morning of the 7th in search of them, but as they had so many days in advance of us and their foot-tracks were nearly everywhere obliterated by recent thunderstorms, our chances of finding them were very much diminished. We spent eight days searching the scrubs in the neighbourhood, but with little success.' (SMH 10 December 1861, p. 5).
<br>
Governor Bowen summarised the Cullin-la-Ringo massacre and the reprisals for it in a letter to the Lord Newcastle. He wrote that after burying the victims of the Cullin-la-Ringo massacre and prior to the arrival of the Native Police a group of armed colonists killed 30 Aboriginal people.
'And now the full extent of the dreadful sacrifice of life was ascertained; and an uncontrollable desire for vengeance took possession of every heart... About thirty of the tribe of murderers are said to have fallen in the deadly struggle which ensued when the eleven English avengers ""stormed their camp"" in the manner related in the enclosure' (QSA GOV/23/61/74 (DR110747) ITM17671, p124). 
<br>
The body of one of the men killed in the reprisal massacres around the Nogoa River was exhibited in The Australian and South Sea Islander Museum in Melbourne:
'One of the most extraordinary curiosities in the museum is the dried body of an aboriginal of North Australia... Some 10 years ago, Nogoa, a station in the north of Queensland, was the scene of a horrible massacre by the blacks. Almost all the residents on the station, comprising some 20 men, women and children, were slaughtered, only some two or three stockmen succeeding, in effecting their escape. The neighbouring country was aroused, and a retaliatory raid was made upon the aborigines by the squatters and native police force, and it is said that the vengeance exacted was terribly severe, the lives of upwards of 200 natives being sacrificed before the wrath of the offended whites was satiated. The particular blackfellow exhibited was, it is stated, shot in a tree into which he had climbed in the hope of concealment.' (The Argus, 5 February 1872, p 6)

After a skirmish in broken ground, during which several were killed, ""the remainder retreated to the top of a high hill, the front of which was almost perpendicular; and on our riding nearer, the Blacks gave us to understand most unmistakeably their intention of holding their ground. I retired"" continues Lieut. Cave, ""a sufficient distance to be completely out of their sight, and camped. Towards sundown, knowing the blacks to be still in the same position, I proceeded cautiously with the Troopers on foot. Two I posted in front of the hill; and with the others I climbed quietly to the top at the back.

'Those <i>kartiya</i> had a lot of rifles and they had men with them too, Aboriginal men. Where could they have been from? Maybe Darwin or Queensland — Aboriginal people who used to live alongside <i>kartiya</i>. They came to shoot. 'Well,' they asked each other, 'where to go from here?' 'We can go up west to Warluk (upstream from Daguragu).' Right here to the west they went on horseback, along the river at Daguragu, going to Seale River (Steven's Creek)... Early in the morning they ambushed people there and shot all the <i>ngumpin</i> there. They shot the whole lot of them right there at the yards at Warluk... Then they went back down to the river. But in the afternoon, two of the <i>kartiya</i> returned. 'You two young blokes go back!' Why did they go back there? What for? They went up-river to the same place near the yard, that very clearing where the dead bodies remained: children, grown men and women who had been shot dead en masse. They had been killed off like dogs from their own country... They just left them there, dead on the ground. The two men heaped up wood until there was a large pyre... They threw them all on the fire.' Two Aboriginal men then speared and killed the two kartiya men by the fire: 'Then they dragged them over to the fire and threw them on top, burning both of them... That's how <i>ngumpin</i> would sometime get their own back.'

The first was led by station owner Lindsay Crawford who rode to Willleroo Station and when he realised that Aboriginal people had taken guns and ammunition from the store he and the party, 'charged' the Aboriginal camp and retrieved some of the weapons.  However he gave no indication of the number of Aboriginal people killed. 
Lewis (2004, pp 243-244) noted: 'A decade later Hely Hutchinson, who passed through Willeroo with drover Rose on his epic trek with cattle from Lissadell Station in 1905, and who met many of the early residents, wrote that [Lindsay] Crawford had ""found the myalls gloriously drunk and capering about the house like a mob of black devils"". Crawford then avenged Scott's death, in a terrible manner, and the ""gruelling"" he gave the myalls on that occasion is still spoken of by the niggers in those parts as the Israelites of old told to their children the horror of the wrath of the Lord, when he sent plague, pestilence and famine into their lands as a correction for their misdeeds... He and his half-caste dealt out white man's justice with their Winchesters, and when the police arrived from Pine Creek, a couple of days later, they found plenty of employment burying the sons of darkness"".' 

The police were Troopers Dooley and Freeman.

A John Giles reported to the <i>Northern Territory Times and Gazette</i>(November 11, 1892, p 3) that ""There were no niggers visible when Mr. Crawford arrived on the Tuesday morning, but that evening he accidentally discovered there were from thirty to forty camped in the horse paddock, about half a mile from the station.

396,td0deb,1336,Willeroo (2),Site,"This massacre is the second of two reprisal massacres following the killing of GS Scott, manager of Willeroo station in October 1892. This group was led by Mounted Constable Browne. Lewis (2004, p 243-244) noted: 'Writing in 1895, Mounted Constable Willshire stated that, ""They were tracked up by an avenging party, and sic transit gloria mundi!"" ('Thus passes the glory of the world')'. (The first was perpetrated by Lindsay Crawford, a well-known station manager in the VRD region, on 20 October 1892, see <a href=""https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1017"">Willeroo #1</a>).
According to Kulumput, as recorded by W. Arndt (1965, p 245), Paddy Cahill was involved in these Willeroo massacres and one occurred in a cave. He also stated it was Bulinara people who were massacred, and Wardaman people later moved into the country as a result of the 'decimation'. 'The Bulinara tribe murdered Syd. Scott, the overseer at Old Willeroo, some time between 1886 and 1892. According to Kulumput the Bulinara tribe was then ""yarded up in a cave"" by the famous Paddy Cahill, who then ""shot the whole blooming lot."" Kulumput's family were ""visiting"" near the V.R.D. homestead at the time of the reprisal, if not at the time of the murder.'(Arndt, 1965, p245) According to Arndt, Kulumput 'was of Yungman-Bulinara extraction, born in Mudbura territory, and an elder in a Wardaman migrant group in Bulinara country.' and respected by Wardaman people because of his birthright to the former Bulinara country of this region (Arndt, 1965, p245).
Kulumput's statement that Paddy was involved in a massacre in a cave accords with the newspaper report that the reprisal parties were headed into rough ranges, 'In addition to the party in charge of Mr. Crawford, there left Springvale on Saturday Messrs M. C. Browne, A. J. Giles, Clarke, Frayne, Palmer, Ah Sing, Joe Wah, five blackboys and some thirty horses, so that the country will get a good turning out, and the culprits will have to show a considerable amount of agility if they wish to keep out of the road. The country about the McClure Creek has always had a bad name on account or the ""cheekiness"" of the natives. There have already been three or four outrages about that district, resulting (I think) in the death of three Europeans. The ranges in the neighbourhood are very high and rough.' (NTTG October 21, 1892, p 3) Since the other recorded incident was at a campsite near the homestead, it would either be this massacre led by Mounted Constable Browne that Paddy Cahill participated in, occurring in a cave, or a third massacre.


These incidents occured at 'Old Willeroo', which is to the south of the later Willeroo Station, about half way to Delamere Station, between tributaries of Victoria River and Aroona River. Davidson, in Archaeological Problems of North Austalia (Davidson, 1935) notes that caves at Willeroo and at Delamere have been inhabited for a long time, and that they are inhabited during the wet season, which is when these massacres occurred). Lewis suggests there may be some confusion in Arndt's reporting of Kulumput's account, because Willeroo is Wardaman country and Bilinara country is further south around Victoria River. The Delamere caves are as close to Old Willeroo as the Willeroo caves, and they are to the south, near the Victoria River tributaries such as Gregory Creek. The Delamere caves are the most likely location then. They are close to Old Willeroo, and where Wardaman and Billinara country meet. This agrees with Kulumput's account that this region was once Billinara country but was populated by Wardaman following the 'decimation' of Billinara people in the massacres. This region between Wardandi and Billinara is also known as Karangpurru (aka Karanga) country. According to Meakins and Nordinger 'The Karrangpurru, who lived to the north of Bilinarra, were virtually wiped out by disease and massacres. Now only a handful of people from one family claim some Karrangpurru heritage.' (Meakins and Nordinger, 2014, p17)

In 1900 Paddy Cahill wrote that '... I had lived on Cullin-la-ringo, a station in Queensland where the whole tribe of blacks were outlawed and shot down by the black police like crows. The reason of their being outlawed was on account of a massacre by them on the station...' He notes that his brother M. Cahill had been speared near where Scott was killed, and some Aboriginal people were shot, that Mr J Bradshaw was attacked on the same route and that he himself had killed Aboriginal people when attacked in this area. 'I could do nothing but shoot as quickly as possible, and I can shoot fairly quickly. I don't know how many niggers I shot - I didn't stop to count them.' (SA Register, 4 Sep 1900, p 6) He also mentions the killing of Scott,

'One glaring case was that of the late W S Scott, of Willeroo Station, one of the kindest men it was possible to find to the natives; yet he was killed by them not far away from his station. The natives, after murdering him, went to the station and tried to kill the cook, but he got away. The black demons then looted the station, and not one of them was punished for his foul work.' (SA Register, 4 Sep 1900, p 6)

This prompted a response from W.A. Millikan, 'Concerning the murder of the late Mr. Scott, of Willeroo Station, whom we all respected, it is absurd for Mr. Cahill to say that ""not one of the blacks was punished for the foul work."" He surely knows that at the time two parties of men stirred to anger and well armed started out professedly to avenge the murder, and were gone some weeks; and was it not an open secret that they made the locality particularly ""unhealthy"" for the ""poor blacks.""' (SA Register, 10 Sep 1900, p5)

In Paddy's reply to Millikan he asked if there were any <i>proof</i> of this and clarified that he meant that no-one had been brought to justice by the <i>police</i>: 

'Again, regarding Scott's murder at Williroo, has Mr. Millikan an proof that blacks were shot by the parties that went out to avenge that outrage? I said in my letter that no blacks were brought to justice by the police, except in one or two cases.' (SA Register, 29 Jan 1901, p 5)

In arguing for increased police presence in the region to bring 'evildoers' to justice, he warned that, 'Unless something like this is done a wholesale murder will take place at some of the stations in the Victoria River district.'

It was at this time that a man named Harry was arrested and gaoled. He was later acquitted. It was probably in about February 1896 that police - notably Mounted Constable E O'Keefe - persuaded two Aboriginal women to entice a ""big mob"" [15-20+?] of Pilinara men to the police station to build a stock yard in return for the policeman providing tobacco and being a ""good boss"". When the men came to the station in the afternoon, they were chained together, which the women told them was to make them ""little bit quiet. Like a dog"". Police trackers, who had been hiding in the creek bed, were ordered into the station. One man was kicked in the ribs before all the men were lined up and shot. Their bodies were taken to the nearby creek bed where they were piled and burnt.

In his words: ""We had just started from the luncheon camp and had hardly gone 300 yards when I noticed some very fresh black's tracks. Knowing that the blacks were very bad in that part of the country I took my rifle from under my saddle flap and filled it with cartridges. I rode on a few yards when one of my boys cried out, 'Look out Paddy!' I knew the blacks must be behind me, so I dodged down alongside my horse's shoulder, and only just in time. A spear struck my hat, going through it, and giving me hard knock on the head. Luckily I am Irish, and a bit thickheaded, so it did very little harm! Before I could say a word, I had niggers all around. I could do nothing but shoot as quickly as possible, and I can shoot fairly quickly. I don't know how many niggers I shot-I didn't stop to count them"".

A report in the <i>NTTG</i> (8 April 1910, p 2) related news from a correspondent at Willeroo Station: ""A poor fellow known as Briglo Bill (J. J. Ward) was murdered by blacks here some time ago. He has been missing in this district for nearly six months, and then the blacks report his murder. I think the police might interest themselves more than they do, especially in this district. The blacks do not fear the police out here in any way, and thousands of cattle are killed by these useless brutes annually."" A court report (<i>NTTG</i>, 16 September 1910, p 3) noted the trial of two Aboriginal people for Ward's murder: ""As in previous case, the crime was apparently an unprovoked and cold-blooded business, chiefly concocted by a lubra named Judy and a native known as Gordon. As a preliminary to the murder the deceased man's only firearm was cunningly stolen by the lubra Judy, and by her handed to her fellow conspirator, Gordon, leaving their intended victim practically at their mercy. A number of natives—including the prisoners Mudgella and Wolgorora—surrounded Ward as he was engaged in burning off grass near his hut, and chasing the doomed man speared him near the door of his house as they would do a kangaroo.
After a patient hearing, the Jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation to mercy, against both the prisoners, upon whom His Honor then passed the death sentence.""

According to the police account of the hunt for his murderers at least one Aboriginal person, Gordon, was shot dead (TCPJ 26-6-1910). However, local knowledge suggests the death toll was higher. Charlie Shultz (pers comm) heard from old-time VRD locals that ""a great many were shot."" Rose quoted Tim Yilngayarri of Yarralin (p 122): ""And you know that Brigalow? Right. Brigalow was doing wrong. He was shooting all the people. Shoot-i-i-n-n-n-g, get all the sing girls for married. Take them down to his place.

417,td0d76,1336,Jurlakkula (Nero Yard),Site,"Ronnie Wavehill Wirrpngayarri (cited in Charola & Meakins, p 45) recounts it in these terms: 'Yet another one was an ambush up at Nero Yard… This is where <i>kartiya</i> ambushed some ngumpin. And what for? Maybe for stealing cattle; that's how they told it to me...They had a big battle there. Spears were aimed and missed... they hooked up the short spears and sent them straight down – couldn't miss! The first one aimed and hit a <i>kartiya</i> right in the belly as soon as he came out from his hiding place. One down! As soon as the other <i>kartiya</i> saw him get speared, they all went running away. Towards here, to the east is where they buried him. At Jurlakkula it happened the same way as at Warluk. They just massacred a whole lot of Aboriginal people. Is it right that <i>kartiya</i> come from another place and wipe out people on their own country? That kind of thing can't be right!'.
<br>
While this massacre is clearly different to the other massacres in the region, estimating a date is difficult. The year 1901 and number killed is a speculation from the following conjecture. This may be a massacre that Paddy Cahill was involved in at Wave Hill.
<br>
In his narrative Ronnie Wavehill Wirrpngayarri says that <i>ngumpin</i> [Aboriginal people] helped the <i>kartiya</i> [colonists] during the killing at Jurlakkula, saying they were from 'maybe Queensland or maybe from somewhere up here' (Charola & Meakins, p 45). While it was common for colonists to have Aboriginal workers, Paddy Cahill was from Queensland and was well known for working with a very close Aboriginal assistant named 'Quilp' and other Aboriginal people (<i>The Register</i>, 3 Mar 1919, p 6; <i>The Register</i> 6 Feb 1923, p 7). 
<br>
Read & Japaljarri (1978, p 147) say that 'A white informant [Dr Stephen Harris] stated that Paddy Cahill, the manager of Oenpelli Station, had been called over in about 1924 to deal with cattle killers. He shot over 30 bush people'. However, Paddy Cahill moved to Oenpelli Station, further north, with his wife in 1906 and, after struggling for flu, died on 4 Feb 1923 in Sydney (NTDB, Vol 1, p 84). The estimated year '1924' must be wrong as he was dead, and while Paddy was famed for riding hundreds of kilometres in a short amount of time, it's less likely he was 'called over' during this more settled phase of his life.
<br>
Paddy's brother, Tommy Cahill, was the manager of Wave Hill Station from 1895 to 1905. Tom Cahill said that, 'At first the natives were very wild and used to give us a lot of trouble, killing our cattle' (SMH, February 19, 1921).
<br>
The Wave Hill station, and more broadly Victoria River District, were violent areas from at least from 1889 when 'Mr. T. Cahill, the station manager, and several of the station men (principally blackboys) were out one day in the locality where ""Paddy the Lasher"" was murdered a couple of years ago.' (<i>Northern Territory Times and Gazette</i> 20 Jan 1899) and continued at least until 1924 when 'the last massacre' (Ward, 2016, p 24) is estimated to have taken place. There were numerous killings and reprisals between these dates, and Paddy was involved in another massacre further north at Willeroo in 1892 (Arndt, 1965, p245) and was attacked at the Gregory Creek/Victoria River junction some time prior to 1900 (<i>The Register</i> 18 Dec 1905, p 6).
<br>
Following an intensification of resistance to colonists around Wave Hill in the 1890s, Paddy wrote a letter complaining that Aboriginal people had not been punished for murders in the Victoria River District, and that in the previous 6 months there had been repeated attacks on travellers and spearing of cattle and horses. He recommended, 'place police enough in the Victoria River district to cope with the blacks... and let us have the evildoers brought to justice' and warned that 'Unless something like this is done a wholesale murder will take place at some of the stations in the Victoria River district' (<i>South Australian Register</i>, 29 Jan 1901, p 5).
Throughout the history of massacres it was common for colonists to complain that Aboriginal people were getting away without being punished for theft and murder and that the Government was not doing anything, or were inneffectual, as a justification for taking matters into their own hands.
<br>
For these reasons the best estimate is that this was a massacre that Paddy Cahill was involved in and that it occurred around 1901 as a reprisal for ongoing violent acts of Aboriginal resistance in the area.",-17.657,130.75,1919-12-10,1920-02-28,"Charola & Meakins, 2016, p 45; <i>Northern Territory Times and Gazette</i> 20 Jan 1899) <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4219064"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4219064</a>;

They went downstream a bit and then out across the rocks. The <i>kartiya</i> [whitefellas] were chasing them on horseback, galloping like mad... The horsemen never caught up to them, so a lot of them got away.' 
<br>
Phillip Yamba Jimmy spoke to the <i>Northern Territory News</i> about Tartarr (Hope, 2016, p 12): 'Men with rifles and Aboriginal trackers returned soon after and shot anyone they could. The version told by Mr Jimmy has it that people were sat around a tree and murdered one by one. He said the families let the dead decompose in the sun then collected the bones in paperbark and carried them 10km to Seale Gorge, a sacred site of the Gurindji and associated tribes...The Tartarr story featured on the 1967 land petition signed in thumbprint by Vincent Lingiari and other Wave Hill walk-off leaders...'. 
<br>
The 1967 Gurindji Petition to the Governor-General (National Museum of Australia 1967, para. 2) included: 'Our people have lived here from time immemorial and our culture, myths, dreaming and sacred places have evolved in this land. Many of our forefathers were killed in the early days while trying to retain it'. And (para. 3): 'We have begun to build our new homestead on the banks of beautiful Wattie Creek in the Seal [sic] Yard area, where there is permanent water. This is the main place of our dreaming only a few miles from the Seal [sic] Gorge where we have kept the bones of our martyrs all these years since white men killed many of our people'.

This oral history appears to be the same massacre which Charlie Ward dates at about 1924: 'Meanwhile, the last massacre in Gurindji country occurred in about 1924 on a small knoll, midway between Vestey's cattle station and the police outpost at Bow Hill. Decades later, an old man remembered: ""They been coming with the horses and found this mob [at] Blackfellow's Knob. They trying to race away from them but they shot them like a dog [...].

23,td0ce3,1336,"Eight Mile Swamp Creek, Bathurst",Site,"Following the Wiradjuri killing of seven workers in a 24 hour period on the Bathurst frontier, a detachment of the 40th regiment and an unknown number of armed and mounted settlers, overseers and stock keepers, set off in revenge. According to historian Stephen Gapps, the posse found some of the Wiradjuri people at Eight Mile Swamp Creek. '[A] volley was discharged  in their midst; and ... some of them dropped, but whether males or females then they did not know.' One of the perpetrators thought that 'one was an old woman, but of the age or the sex of the others, they pleaded ignorance' (Gapps, 2021 p 145) The bodies of three women were found. 
In the aftermath, six of the men who discharged their muskets were arrested and charged with manslaughter and five of them were sent to Sydney for trial.  The Attorney-General Saxe Bannister, said that the action against the women was not an act of self-defence and that the law held no difference between individuals white or black. (Gapps 2021, pp.164-5). At the trial  in early July 1824, magistrate William Cox said that the killing was justified because 'the natives may now be called at war with the Europeans, and that in his opinion, resistance is justifiable.' (quoted in Gapps 2021, p.166). He also argued that Governor Macquarie's Proclamation of 1816 which said that Aboriginal people must stay away from the frontier, was still in force.

Lowe and a convict stock worker ran to Lewis's hut to inform him of the murder and next morning Lewis rode to his neighbour, settler John Tindale at 'Warren Gunyah'.  Both men set off for Bathurst to alert the magistrate Major James Morisset. En route they found one of Tindale's huts burnt down and the burnt bodies of his workers, John Dowden and James Florid.  Further on, they found the body of another of Tindale's workers, James Buckley.  (Gapps, 2021, p.138)
According to historian Stephen Gapps, the location of the attacks, 'is near where the Turondale Road today crosses Millah Murrah Creek between Duramana and Turondale'. (Gapps 2021, p. 139)
When Lewis and Tindale returned to Lewis's station, a detachment of soldiers had arrived with more bad news. At nearby Millah Murrah station, owned by Samuel Terry, the soldiers had 'found the bodies of two convict shepherds', John Donnelly and Joseph  Rose and hired servant David Brown. (Gapps 2021, p.140-1). 
 Over a period of 24 hours,  Wiradjuri warriors had killed seven colonial workers on the Bathurst frontier, then the furthest frontier west of Sydney.  The killings constituted a massacre.

112,td628e,1336,King's Plains,Site,"A traveller through the King's Plains reported that during the conflict with Wiradjuri people in 1824, there had been 'much bloodshed' and 'slaughter': 
<br>
'King's Plains are swampy, and have been generally, and are now chiefly located
for the depasturing of cattle. During the period of hostilities with the natives in 1824, this vicinity was the scene of much bloodshed. The atrocities of these misguided people on that occasion, called forth the most active measures of the local authorities, in which nearly all the respectable settlers of the district joined, under the direction of the then Commandant, Colonel Morisset. Before the termination of hostilities, martial law being in full operation, the slaughter was dreadful, but the result decidedly proved the good policy of the course adopted, for since that time the most amicable feeling has subsisted between the Aboriginal and Anglo-Australians' (<i>The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 19 Jan 1832, p 3).
<br>
This account is clear about the location of the massacre and its connection to Morriset's campaign in September 1824. Beyond that it is difficult to assign the massacre to any particular group of perpetrators. 
<br>
Historian Stephen Gapps relates that Morisset sent a detachment to Swallow Creek following a raid by Wiradjuri people at King's Plains. Two Aboriginal people were reported killed and three taken prisoner. However, Gapps notes that much of the killing during 1824 may have been done by colonists other than soldiers. 'Uncle Bill Allen Junior and other Wiradyuri people today, however, are clear that it was not necessarily the ""redcoats"" who conducted the killings at this time, but rather that the declaration of martial law and the conditions surrounding the military campaign allowed for an ""open slather"" of violence' (Gapps, 2021, p 181).
<br>
Killings in this area may have also occurred as part of Morisset's campaign. According to Gapps, while two divisions headed north east the division lead by 'Magistrate Walker headed to the west' (Gapps, 2021, p 173). However, this appears to be the western arm of Morisset's sweep to the north.",-33.433,149.286,1824-09-01,1824-01-01,"<i>The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 19 Jan 1832, p 3 <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2204528'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2204528</a>; Gapps, 2021",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1118,2024-11-17 15:37:11,2024-11-17 15:37:11,1118,Wiradjuri,NSW,NSW,,,,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,6,,Colonists,0,"Settler(s), Soldier(s)",,Reprisal,Firearm(s),*,,,,,,,18,7,4,Wiradjuri/Bathurst,South ,Wiradjuri/Bathurst: South ,East,Early

After a battle with boomerangs and muskets, Chamberlain shot dead 'Blucher' and two other warriors (Gapps 2021, pp.6-7). The following day, Chamberlain and the two stockmen were returning to Mudgee, when they encountered about 40 Wiradjuri warriors and after a battle, 16 were killed.  
<br>
'It appeared that the whole of the natives had been engaged in burying the three men that had been killed the preceding day. The party immediately dismounted, and heaped the whole of the arms on the fires; and, whilst they were in the act of burning the same, a large number of natives (men, women, and children), came suddenly towards them. The overseer and his two men immediately mounted their horses and retreated, followed by about 40 native men; but they had few arms with them, which they threw with great fury. The overseer, warily watching the natives, and finding that they had nearly expended their arms, he and his men dismounted, tied their horses together, and faced about, commencing a fire of musquetry on the natives, then charged them with the bayonet until they were completely routed and dispersed. The natives left sixteen men dead on the field, and their weapons were completely destroyed.'

148,td0cd2,1336,"Round Swamp, Turon River",Site,"In his <i>Reminiscences 1825-1826</i> LE Threlkeld, a missionary, wrote that,
'There were many European 
stock-holders who had suffered severely from the 
depredations of the Aborigines, and consequently were 
infuriated against the Blacks. One of the largest holders 
of sheep in the Colony, maintained at a public meeting 
at Bathurst, that the best thing that could be done, would 
be to shoot all the Blacks and manure the ground with 
their carcases, which was all the good they were fit for! 
It was recommended likewise that the Women and 
Children should especially be shot as the most certain 
method of getting rid of the race. Shortly after this 
declaration, martial law was proclaimed, and sad was the 
havoc made upon the tribes at Bathurst. A large number 
were driven into a swamp, and mounted police rode 
round and round and shot them off indiscriminately until 
they were all destroyed! When one of the police enquired 
of the Officer if a return should be made of the killed, 
wounded there were none, all were destroyed, Men 
Women and Children! the reply was; - that there was 
no necessity for a return. But forty-five heads were collected 
and boiled down for the sake of the skulls! My informant, 
a Magistrate, saw the skulls packed for exportation in a 
case at Bathurst ready for shipment to accompany the 
commanding Officer on his voyage shortly afterwards 
taken to England' (Threlkeld in Gunson, 1974, pp 48-9).
<br>
The 'mounted police' mentioned by Threlkeld were not formed until after 1824 but Threlkeld would have assumed these to be the forces involved through his familiarity with their activities in the Hunter Valley (Connor, 2002 pp 62-69).
<br>
The incident described most likely occurred during Commander Morisset's expeditions in Wiradjuri country around Bathurst in September 1824. This expedition included divisions led by magistrates Mr Lawson, Mr Ranken, and Mr Walker (Gapps, 2021, p 172). The magistrate mentioned by Threlkeld is probably one of these, though Stephen Gapps suggests it could have been Lieutenant Percy Simpson, commandant at Wellington in 1824 (Gapps, 2021, p 188). Gapps also notes that Commandant Morisset returned to England in 1825 (Gapps, 2021, p 189) and so was most likely the 'commanding Officer' mentioned.
<br>
According to military historian John Connor (Connor 2002, p59-61), following the declaration of martial law in the Bathurst District in August 1824, about forty soldiers from the 40th Regiment led by the Commandant at Bathurst, Major Morisset, three magistrates and three mounted settlers and some Aboriginal guides set off for the region north of Bathurst. Morisset made no report of the entire Bathurst operation (Connor, 2002, p59). Gapps also notes that, 'It is likely that Morrisset made a verbal report to Governor Brisbane when he went to Sydney after the campaign - or a written report has not survived' (Gapps, 2021, p 174).
<br>
According to Gapps, 'With extra soldiers having now arrived from Sydney, making eighty-five men under his command, Morisset had enough military strength to send out a strong punitive expedition.' This force was divided into three divisions and departed on or about the 18th of September, 'in a great sweep of the terrain up to 160 kilometres around Bathurst' (Gapps, 2021, p 172).
This was reported in the Sydney Gazette:
'The Commandant, with four Magistrates, about forty soldiers, and six mounted settlers, left Bathurst for Mudgee a few days after; and as the overseer and several of the mounted settlers know that part of the country well, there is every reason to hope that they will come up with the natives and put an end to this sanguinary and desultory warfare' (<i>The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 30 Sep 1824, p 2).
<br>
One of the members of the expedition, Magistrate Ranken, wrote in a letter that they had not encountered their enemy on this expedition, but that 'Morriset goes off to Bathurst tomorrow with Lawson, the rest of us scour the country between this and Wallerawang, where Morisset and Lawson will join us, and I shall immediately start for home' (Ranken in Gapps, 2021, p 176). Gapps notes that 'While the last few days of Morisset's campaign are not reported anywhere and have been seen as a ""killing spree"" by some, there is no historical evidence to support this beyond Lowe's indirect reference. It seems more likely that much of the ""war of extermination"" was carried out by others' (Gapps, 2021, p 177).
<br>
Given that this relatively large force had been amassed and set out specifically to engage the enemy, that there was a popular expectation that this would end the war, that official reports were either not made or went missing, and that there is no record of what happened in the final phase of the expeditions, and Threlkeld's description tend to match this expedition, it is most likely that the massacre described by Threlkeld happened during the last phase of Morrissett's expedition.
<br>
Furthermore, there is no reason Wiradjuri people and their allies would have ceased their successful resistance unless there had been a catastrophic event to cause it. Only a month after reporting that Morisset's expedition had set out, the Sydney Gazette reported Wiradjuri people coming to Bathurst to make peace. 
'A respectable settler from Bathurst only very
lately, informs us, that the day prior to his setting
out for the capital, two tribes of the natives, comprising about 60 in number, came in to Bathurst on
the usual peaceable footing. Saturday [Windradyne], who has
rendered himself so notorious in the aboriginal
annals, still thinks it prudent to keep out of reach,
and has not even been heard of' (<i>The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 28 Oct 1824, p 2).
In late December 140 Wiradjuri people, including Windradyne travelled to Parramatta for an annual feast held for Aboriginal people (Gapps, 2021, p 197). 
The Sydney Gazette reported that, 'Between one and two
o'clock, a reinforcement of the Bathurst tribe arrived, which was supposed to have increased the
number to near upon 400 - by far the greatest
number ever known to have assembled on any similar occasion.' 
and that 'Saturday [Windradyne] wore a
straw hat, on which was affixed a label, with the
word ""PEACE"" inserted, besides a little branch
representing the olive' (<i>The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 30 Dec 1824, p 2). Windradyne had not come willingly, 'He had been prevailed
upon to come by one of the constables, we believe, of the district, and was accompanied over the Mountains by two or three
gentlemen, who experienced some difficulty occasionally in getting him forward.' and, in spite of the hat, maintained his dignity, 'There
is a grandeur of expression in his face — a dignity and grace in
his manner, which civilised majesty could not exceed' (<i>The Australian</i>, 30 Dec 1824, p 3).
<br>
It was Morisset's unrecorded in person report that convinced the governor that the peace was real enough to end martial law (Gapps, 2021, p 196). This suggests Morisset had information that could not be made public but was of a decisive nature and which he was privy to. Killing was carried out by colonists in this war as well as by government forces (Uncle Bill Allen in Gapps, 2021, p 181). John Connor suggests that the sudden surrender after an otherwise effective resistance could be explained by a massacre a week before Morisset arrived in the area, in which an 'overseer at Mudgee, and two stockmen killed sixteen Wiradjuri, probably all at men, including a leader known by the settlers as ""Blucher""' (Connor, 2002, p 61). This would have had a major impact, however, Wiradjuri forces were divided into seperate operational groups and Blucher's group were not the only one. Windradyne, a wiley, proud and tenacious leader, was still at large. The earlier massacre at Mudgee accounts for why Morisset's force could not engage Wiradjuri forces in the north - they would have evaded them elsewhere by then. Descriptions of killings in various specific locations surviving in Wiradjuri oral history (Gapps, 2021, p 189) suggest that more incidents occured than were recorded in writing by colonists. Although attacks beyond the law could be brutal and devastating, it is most likely not sporadic skirmishes and attacks from colonists against Wiradjuri people that brought an end to the war. Although Morisset often complained of a lack of horses because foot soldiers could easily be evaded, the divisions included 'a mounted reconnaissance arm, and a cavalry element' (Gapps, 2021, p175). It is more likely that the war was ended by a combination of attacks from colonists with a decisive attack made by the combined military and militia force that set out on a methodical campaign with the specific purpose of engaging their enemy and ending the war that ended the war.
<br>
Locating this massacre is difficult with the scant information available. Threlkeld indicates only that it occurred in a swamp. There are many places in Wiradjuri country that could be the swamp. Gapps notes that the locations of killings recorded in Wiradjuri oral history 'on the Cudgegong at Dabee, the Bogee Swamp, or the Brymair Valley all fit the description of a ""swamp""' (Gapps, 2021, p 189). One of these stories involves 'redcoats' (Descendent of Jimmy Lambert in Gapps, 2021, p 185). These are in valleys far to the east. These regions would be an ideal area for a resistance force, with a 10km region including wetlands surrounded by a horseshoe of steep ranges, and adjoining the impregnable Wollemi region. It took Ranken 10 days to reach the Hunter Valley after separating from Morisset and meet him again at Mudgee. It is unlikely that Ranken's division would have been able to make it this far east through more rugged country on the way to Wallerawang.
<br>
A traveller in 1832 reported that King's Plains were 'swampy' and that in 1824, settlers and soldiers had been called together 'under the direction of the then Commandant, Colonel Morisset', and a 'slaughter' had occurred (<i>The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 19 Jan 1832, p 3). However, it's not clear whether the reference is to Colonel Morisset's command at that time generally or a specific expedition. When Ranken and Morisset left Mudgee, Morisset went south towards Bathurst and Ranken went south east to rendezvous at Wallerawang. It is possible if riding hard but unlikely that Morisset's force would have ridden south to Bathurst then west to King's Plains, before riding east to Wallerawang for the rendezvous with Ranken.
<br>
Having failed to engage the enemy in the north, it's likely Morisset took the most direct route back to Bathurst, which is similar to the main road between Mudgee and Bathurst today, following the Cudgegong River before heading to Bathurst (Baker & Mitchell, 1843). He may have encountered Wiradjuri near the Turon River on the way [note: this massacre site was previously marked at Turon River]. Morisset and Ranken's forces probably separated at the Cudgegong River where it turns east, with Morisset taking valleys to the south west and Ranken heading through valleys to the south east.
<br>
William Lawson, who had preceded Morisset as commandant at Bathurst had written that he was 'afraid we shall never exterminate them, they having such an extensive mountainous country for them to flee from their pursuers' (Lawson in Gapps, 2021, p 151). Swamps near mountains would be ideal for Aboriginal warriors evading colonial forces, being a cornucopia of food, requiring local knowledge to navigate around wetter parts, and offering a retreat into mountains. Directly on the route through the valley between the Cudgegong River and Wallerawang is a large area named 'Round Swamp', feeding into the Turon River, within 4 kilometres of mountain ranges on either side, with the Capertee Ranges on the eastern side being especially rugged. W.H. Suttor describes two massacres that are different in their details to Threlkeld's description, but also mentions more generally that, 'Under this condition of things [martial law] the blacks were shot down without any respect. Getting the worst of it, most of them [Aboriginal people] made into the deep dells of the Capertee country, and, although some escaped, many were killed there' (Suttor, 1887, p45). Given that Wiradjuri warriors had not been detected by 3 groups sweeping the north as far as the Hunter Valley, it's reasonable to think they had evaded detection in the ranges and valleys further east. Given that Morisset dispatched Ranken in that direction it is likely this was also Morisset's surmise. Ranken's disappointment at not encountering enemies suggests that if he did encounter them he would have attacked with full force. While there are various possibilities, it seems most likely that the large massacre Threlkeld speaks of occurred near Round Swamp between the Cudgegong River and Wallerawang.",-33.078,149.939,1824-09-18,1824-09-30,"Gunson, 1974; Connor, 2002; <i>The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 30 Sep 1824, p2 <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2183259'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2183259</a>;

They were antagonistic towards the Yolngu from the start. Macartney and Mayne set up Florida Station near the present day town of Ramingining. When some Yolngu killed a cow for food, the station owners killed a group of Yolngu with poisoned horsemeat. This started a guerrilla war by the Yolngu. The station workers had guns. Yolngu had spears and knowledge of fire and the country. Yolngu killed station workers and drove off the cattle. By 1893 it was all over. The station was abandoned and the remaining cattle moved south to another location.'
<br>
Trudgen wrote (2000, pp 19-20): '... some months later the pastoralists came with one of their wagons, offering horsemeat to many of the clans... That evening they ate, thanking the pastoralists for their good gifts. It was only when some of the people became violently ill that the Yolngu realised the Balanda had tricked them with some strange sorcery...  Members of many clans died that day... Yolngu struck back, fighting with spears against muskets and carbines. Soon the skirmishes became running battles'. Men, women and children were killed by the poisoning.

<br>
Aboriginal people from a camp at Mirki were killing cattle on Florida Station, near Milingimbi. After confessing to cattle killing, an Aboriginal person was murdered. Attempting a surprise night attack on people singing and dancing at a ceremony, the colonists left their horses and surrounded them. But Aboriginal lookouts saw the horses and, thinking they couldn't escape without being seen, hid in the trees. 'Into a tree they climbed, all of them. They sat there, they didn't say anything, nothing. They were very careful for each other' (Read & Read, 1991, p 22). The colonists saw them in the trees and opened fire. 'Think about the noise that those guns made, shooting up into the trees. Shooting, shooting, shooting, up in to the trees. They all fell down into the ground, and just lay there all over the ground, every one of them, until they were all dead. But one of them was still alive. The horses had passed him on the way there. He saw them, and he hid in the cycad palms, underneath them' (Read & Read, 1991, p 22).
The following day the 'boss' of the colonists took a repeating rifle, found the children, formed them into two lines and shot them. 'Every one of them, just lying there, and not only a few, lots of them' (Read & Read, 1991, p 24).
<br>
 Gaunt said that Jack Waston was in that area at that time, along with Joe Bradshaw and others, 'Before closing this article I wish to say soon after Jack Watson left Florida Station he was at the Katherine' and indicated that shooting Aboriginal people was common, 'The shooting of blacks in the early days was necessary to the men who opened up the country. Self-preservation is the first law of nature and with very little police protection we had to take the law in our own hands, or be massacred in cold blood by the abos' (<i>Northern Standard</i> July 10, 1934, p 6).",-12.104,134.911,1889-01-01,1896-12-31,"Read and Read, 1991, p 24; Gaunt 1934,  'Old Time Memories, The Lepers of Arnheim [sic] Land and Sketches' <i>Northern Standard</i> July 10, 1934, p 6 <a href=""http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48064622"">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48064622</a>; van der Heide, 1985, p 16.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=713,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:54,713,"Yolngu, Djinang",SA,NT,Port Darwin,1889-1896,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,40,,Colonists,0,Pastoralist(s),Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),**,0,Certainly dozens of Aboriginal people from a camp named Mirki.,Mirki,,,,48,27,3,Yolngu,Mid,Yolngu: Mid,North,North
292,td0ca6,1336,Arafura Station,Site,"In colonial pastoral terms, Arnhem Land was dominated by Florida Station (1884-1893) leased by John Arthur Macartney (of Macartney & Mayne fame) after which some of the same land became incorporated into Florida Station (1903-1908) leased by the Eastern and African Cold Storage Company. Generally, the area was known as Murwangi to Yolngu people.
<br>
When Arafura Station was owned by Eastern & African Cold Storage Co, the company employed groups to ride around shooting Aboriginal people. Merlan (1978, p 87) wrote that 'This was
probably one of the few authenticated instances in which the aborigines were systematically hunted. For a time the company employed
2 gangs of 10 to 14 blacks headed by a white man or half caste to hunt and shoot the wild blacks on sight. When interviewed in 1957 George Conway mentioned that he had been hired to lead a hunting expedition into Arnhem Land in 1905 or 1906, and that his party had killed dozens of Aborigines.'
<br>
According to Dewar's research (1995, p 9): 'A further attempt was made to develop a pastoral industry when Arafura Station was taken up by the African Cold Storage Supply Company in 1903 in central Arnhem Land. Arafura Station was not a commercial success (Bauer 1964, 157) and the company was liquidated in 1908. The station is remembered today for the extreme violence of its managers. Accounts have been collected from both Yolngu and non-Aboriginals who remember the massacres of Yolngu in the area (Bauer 1964, 157; Dreyfus & Dhulumburrk 1980, 19-20; Read and Read 1991, 19-24; Van der Heide 1985, 15, 16, 52, 53).'
<br>
Jack 'the Gulf Hero' Watson was a Manager of Florida Station. He had been at Lawn Hill in Queensland as an employee of Frank Hann and was notorious for killing Aboriginal people, such as at the <a href=""https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=995"">Skeleton Creek</a> massacre. <br>
In addition to Conway and others, Joe Bradshaw was employed at Arafura by the Eastern & African Cold Storage Co.  Joe Bradshaw was the general manager for a time (Northern Territory Times and Gazette, 17 March 1905, p 3) and spent many years in the Victoria River Downs area, including on Bradshaw Station, where there were many massacres. 
<br>
According to C.E. Gaunt, Jack Watson was responsible for killing many people while he was on Florida: 
'After the Randalls left, Jack Watson ""The Gulf Hero,"" as he was known to old timers, took charge and became manager...
To return to Florida, when managing that place when the abos. stepped over the line, Watson threw the lead at them, and threw it to kill. He had the blacks of Blue Mud and Caledon Bays good hombres, but he had to wipe out a lot to make them so.
In all the early days of Florida there was not a white man attacked or killed by blacks. The men of Florida knew how to handle blacks and then the Missionary came on the scene and made a rascal out of the abo. Then the trouble and killing of whites started. This is cold facts. Eventually Florida Station was abandoned, the chief cause being loss of stock by blacks. This was after Watson left' (Northern Standard, 6 Jul 1934, p 4).
<br>
It is difficult to isolate individual incidents, but Conway said that he killed dozens during only one expedition of one of the two gangs mentioned. In a quote relating to an expedition through Yolngu country to Caledon Bay, Conway notes that Yolngu camps were very large 'Some of their camps contained two or three thousand people' (Willey, 1964, p 103). It is reasonable to think at least 200 people were massacred by the killing 'gangs' at Florida and Arafura under Conway, Bradshaw and Watson.",-12.461,134.984,1903-01-01,1908-07-30,"Merlan, 1978, pp 87-88; Dewar, 1992, p 9; Northern Standard, 6 Jul 1934, p 4 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/48064516"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/48064516</a>; Northern Territory Times and Gazette, 17 March 1905, p 3 <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4328639/828514"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4328639/828514</a>; Willey, K, 1964, p 103; Olney J, 2003, p 47.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=1056,2024-06-01 00:06:20,2024-11-17 15:29:53,1056,"Yolngu, Djinang",SA,NT,Port Darwin,1906,,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,200,Aboriginal,Colonists,0,"Stockmen/Drover(s), Pastoralist(s)",Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),**,0,"men, women and children",Murwangi or Murruwangi,,1903-1908: Arafura Station,,39,8,3,Yolngu,Late,Yolngu: Late,North,Late

The events described indicate a high death toll, but that more escaped at Birany Birany, so the number of victims at Birany Birany may have been lower than at Gan Gan.

She adds that, ""This was not the end of the story though Bill Harney returned the next year and collected the skulls of the people he had murdered. And later sold them to a museum in southern cities and made a lot of money.'(Yunupingu, B p 13) Following this Yunupingu's people killed 2 or Harney's men at Trial Bay, and Bill Harney returned and massacred people at Birany Birany (Yunupingu, B p 15).

In the Preface to Bronwyn Wuyuwa Yunupingu <i>A True, Bad Story</i> Devlin wrote: 'The Bilayni or Bill Harney of this story is not to be confused with the man of the same name who was at one stage Protector of the Aborigines in the late 1940s and who later became an authority on Aboriginal matters'. Devlin said he had interviewed Birrikitji Gumana (the father of Gawirrin) who 'asserted without hesitation' that the Bilayni of the Gangan story 'came, murdered and was never seen again'. Using genealogical methods Devlin concluded the Gangan incident took place 'possibly a little before the war (1914-18)'. He therefore concluded that the Bilayni of the story was not the Bill Harney 'who was in the Gove area in 1946' (Yunupingu, B p i).
The events described indicate a high death toll, but that more escaped at Birany Birany, so the number of victims at Birany Birany may have been lower than at Gan Gan. Other massacres with recorded death tolls in this region and time, tend to average around 20 to 30. Warren Snowdon, when speaking of the death of Dr Gumana, said that, 'Dr Gumana spoke about a vengeance massacre of up to 30 of his people at Gangan when he was a young boy' (Snowdon, 2016). Galarrwuy Yunupingu said that 'an entire clan group' was killed and Bronwyn Wuyuwa Yunupingu indicated two groups were at the ceremony. The minimum size of a viable a clan group is about 20 (Mann, 2013 p 167-183) and they may be much larger. Since this was a large massacre, and there may have been two clan groups, 25 killed at Gan Gan is a conservative estimate.",-13.046,135.944,1911-01-01,1913-12-31,"Yunupingu, B 1981 <a href=""https://territorystories.nt.gov.au/10070/871805/0"">https://territorystories.nt.gov.au/10070/871805/0</a>; Yunupingu, G 2016 <a href=""https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2016/july/1467295200/galarrwuy-yunupingu/rom-watangu"">https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2016/july/1467295200/galarrwuy-yunupingu/rom-watangu</a>; NAA, <i>Uncommon Lives</i>, Dhakiyarr Wirrpanda <a href=""https://www.naa.gov.au/students-and-teachers/learning-resources/learning-resource-themes/first-australians/history/yolgnu-elder-dhakiyarr-wirrpanda-high-court-case"">https://www.naa.gov.au/students-and-teachers/learning-resources/learning-resource-themes/first-australians/history/yolgnu-elder-dhakiyarr-wirrpanda-high-court-case</a>; Warren Snowdon MHR, 2016 <a href=""https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debate/?id=2016-11-23.156.2"">https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debate/?id=2016-11-23.156.2</a>; Gumana, B biography <a href=""https://www.aboriginal-bark-paintings.com/birrikidji-gumana/"">https://www.aboriginal-bark-paintings.com/birrikidji-gumana/</a>; Rothwell, N 2007; Yunupingu G 2017, p 54-55; Mann, B.A. 2013.",https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=715,2024-06-01 00:06:22,2024-11-17 15:29:54,715,Yolngu – Dhalwangu and Gumatj people,NT,NT,Darwin,1911,Day,Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander People,25,,Colonists,0,Mounted Police,Horse,Reprisal,Firearm(s),**,0,"Men, women and children.",Gangan,,,,39,8,3,Yolngu,Late,Yolngu: Late,North,Late
